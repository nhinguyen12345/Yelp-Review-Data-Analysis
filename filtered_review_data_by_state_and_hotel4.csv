ehd9wCm_GUlLHsS3OUPBQw,uvePkSu2gQgZFLsqApowlg,jTI5Xjk27An8ceJ6VwpXiQ,3,0,0,0,"Booked a 1 King Bed Executive on the 24th floor and the view of the city from that high above was amazing. However, I had a couple of problems with the professionalism of the staff which is why I rated three stars instead of five. I can't help but make this personal and say that I wasn't treated with equal warmness and courtesy because of my appearance. Coming from a red eye flight, I arrived at the hotel with sweatpants and frazzled hair. I do have tattoos and I'm in my early twenties so I felt like the staff regarded me as not as significant as the other guests. I had a couple of rude stares initially and when I visited the executive lounge (which requires a key) for some breakfast I received an almost, ""Who let you in?"" look from the woman serving breakfast. With that said, the room service operator seemed quite irritated whenever she took my orders but the actual room service deliverers were quite friendly, so I made sure to tip them well. Food and beverage could do some work, it's the not the worst but definitely not the best, especially for the price. I had free wi-fi with my stay, so that was very nice and convenient. Overall, I would stay again at the DoubleTree in Center City just because my stay wasn't awful but the staff definitely needs to brush up on their services techniques and courtesies. Just because someone is young and underdressed and has tattoos does not make them less worthy of respect. My money is as good as anyone else's.",2015-05-12 19:43:45

General speaking, the facility is OK but the management and service is not professional. When I talk to staff, I feel like they are more like staff who operates a family Inn or a lodge...

Good things: 
1. complementary breakfast, good quality and variety
2. facility is good, lobby is comfortable, in-door pool is kids friendly, a good out-door jacuzzy
3. location is convenient for car and air transportation

Bad things: 
1. very loud heater in room
2. unprofessional receptionists, apparently they were not trained, a few examples: a young boy staff was collecting towers in the in-door pool, one tower was used by some guest to clean the car maybe so has lots of dirt on it, the staff said bad words in front of some kids nearby; I one time pass-by the lobby and hear some staff members were complaining about some customers loudly; housekeeping on busy hours occupied both elevators for a couple of hours and long queues were accumulated on almost every floor. On 12/31/12 the breakfast was gone some fast and starting from 8:30am the refill was kind of stopped. The promised breakfast ends at 9:30am

Wouldn't recommend is you have other choices.",2013-01-02 22:29:32

Loved the little cereal boxes and milk you can take for the little ones. There was always plenty of food when I went and the to go Seattles best coffee was genius! Most of the staff was friendly; one suggested we take their shuttle to the airport, which is across the street and then shuttle from there to one of the casinos. As we were carless, this was much appreciated. The free ice was helpful, as we kept a nice ice chest with plenty of drinks and the soaps, shower, fridge were much appreciated. The pressure on the water was a little much for my toddler but I enjoyed it. Knocked off a star because the pool was only open for a limited time. I wish I could have enjoyed maybe a few extended hours during my trip there. Pool closes at 10 and with the busy schedule we had, we never made it over there. Also, while most staff was friendly there were some glaring front desk staff that made this place seem quite stuffy and unwelcoming for us. We paid over $600 for the three nights we were there. Certainly expected a much more welcoming staff for that price. We will not be staying here in the future because to me, customer service is EVERYTHING.

Oh how lovely to wake up Tuesday morning and be peppered with insect bites after sleeping in the second bed in my hotel room at The DoubleTree by Hilton Center City Philadelphia. What else is lovely is how rude and inconsiderate the staff has been on the matter. How they have the nerve to say to me, ""where else have you been?"" Where they have the gaul to lock me out of my room as I handle the matter. You told my boss I was angry and making a scene and drawing other guests into, which is absolutely not true. Why? Because I'm a black woman? Maybe I should have made a scene because clearly the diplomatic route is pointless. Where they insist I am lying because they can't find a bed bug when they ""inspect."" Absence of evidence is not proof. You know what is proof? The bites in these photos that I did not have Monday night when I showered and went to bed, but definitely had Tuesday morning when I woke up and now on Wednesday are swollen enough to make movements difficult. Where they send a man to a woman's room to come and inspect my things who then mansplains to me about bed bugs. The service at this establishment is already awful and I could let pretty much all of that slide, but I have been HARMED by this hotel and the staff's behavior is just kneading the harm. I have stayed at this chain before and enjoyed my stay (Scottsdale location is stellar!), so I was looking forward to my stay at The DoubleTree by Hilton City Center Philadelphia. Apparently my expectations were too high for even subpar service. Whatever happened to, ""if you're not satisfied with your stay, let us know and we'll make it right?"" So reads the sign in all your guest rooms. I did let you know and you belittled me, embarrassed me, ignored me, locked me out, and then gave me a sack of your cookies on my way out the door. I've had better experiences at hostels! Time to call the Department of Health. BUT FOR sleeping in this bed, at this hotel, I would not have hot welts the size of my hand on my torso and I wouldn't have to burn all my things. Now I am making a scene.",2017-06-08 00:07:30
XgEHrMlpI_aUv9mU6UE_jQ,iV4iNc1nquv-zUdTwJBH1Q,zJErbOQMKX-MwHs_ulV7DA,2,0,0,0,"If you are going to Philly and wanting to see historical sites this is an excellent location.  The rooms are clean and the prices are what you would expect to pay for a nice place in such a desirable location.  

The thing this place needs to work on is service.  From the bell hops, to check in to the concierge to bartender to the waitresses.  The manager should be put in a historical stockade because if their service and attitude is that poor throughout the entire hotel it must stem from the leadership.  

We got out of our car and the bell hop told us how to take our things out of the car and he told me to move my tailgate so he could maneuver around easier.  He told us valet was too expensive but he had difficulty describing where we needed to park and it was two blocks away.  

At check in we were told our rooms were not ready but it was our fault because we needed to have rooms next to each other.  She wasn't the least bit concerned the rooms weren't ready.  She told us green at some hotels means one thing but at this hotel it means no maid service at all.  

The rooms are nice and large.  Beds and bedding very nice.  Bathroom would've failed the q-tip test.  The air exchange was disgusting.  Water is free with two bottles, but sitting right next to a large bottle that is $2.  Looked like a set up!  Wi-fi is a charge, typical, but not always.  

The gym is just a few treadmills.  (Not that we expect a full gym but this was less than hotel average.)

The club didn't open until 5:30 for happy hour.  It may be 5 o'clock somewhere but not at this place!  Snacks were not replaced at night when you need them.  Breakfast is slim pickings but expected free cuisine.  

We asked the front desk a simple question about National Park tickets and she directed us to the Concierge Desk.  He was talking to another employee and they made us wait forever to finish their conversation.  Then he seemed bothered.  

After a concert we returned to the hotel around 10pm for a night cap and the bartender didn't say hello, didn't smile but told us that this would be our only drink because he was shutting down.  Not very smart, we tip well, and there were a dozen people enjoying the Olympics and spending money.  

So the bottom line is this...this is a nice clean hotel, and in a great location and priced right for the area...HOWEVER...the staff and service are so rude it was a struggle to even give 2 stars.  About the worst we have ever had.  Service makes all the difference.  Fire the manager and start are over with hiring.  Not up to Sheraton standards.",2016-08-14 22:00:13
G3yDORZ00fTqiNA0zo4cpw,mmCOgzbtJlprGN6C4ZXmhQ,_d5OAxaxRPsivgYbBq7U1A,3,0,0,0,"The hotel was okay.  The night I stayed here wasn't busy at all.

The hotel is located in a part of King of Prussia that really isn't convenient to the rest of King of Prussia.  And the Pennsylvania Turnpike is immediately behind the hotel.  Since my room overlooked the Turnpike, I did at times a low hum at times through the course of the evening.  If I stayed here again, I would ask for a room that didn't face the Turnpike.

The room itself was nice.  The bed was in a back part and the sofa was in the front part.  A piece of furniture divides the two parts, in which you will find the ice bucket.  On this piece of furniture is the television, which swiveled back and forth so you could watch either on bed or on the sofa.

With the ice buckets were two glasses.  I hate glasses in a hotel.  In all of the hotels that I've stayed, I've never seen a housekeeper take the glasses down to be washed.  So I am sure that they just rinse them off in the sink.  Even though it looks tacky, I would much prefer plastic cups sealed in plastic.

Also you won't have to worry about scalding yourself in the shower because it took almost 10 minutes to warm up to a decent temperature.  And the hotel wasn't busy.  I could only imagine if the place was busy.

The free breakfast isn't something to look forward to.  There were 4 little pancakes out on a skillet.  I took 2 and both had the texture of being out for a while.  They also a couple of little breakfast sandwiches, they looked like they have been out for a while.

But one time in the middle March  2017 we did.One huge problem  is the customer service.
Before checking in, I called to see if our room was available   I spoke to a man who was later identified as Josh ( last name initial T)- a manager or supervisor. I normally in case we want an early check in. I also ask for extra towels. My gf and I both have health issues and require a fair amount of extra towels. When  I asked  a specific amount ,  Josh stated that they could give a few extra towels but they couldn't.. They claimed they  couldn't provide that many .  But that turns out it wasn't the case. I asked if they had a full house the night before and he said yes. It doesn't seem to be the case though.
When I checked in I spoke to a  different person- a woman  who wrote down the towels I asked for and sent us up to our room assuring us that they would be send up.

That also wasn't the case

 10 min after we were in the room, Josh called and they couldn't send up that many
I said I  have been to this hotel before and they always ( at least in the past - had no problem providing me with my  needed amount of towels. I was just there a week earlier and they were fine with the number of towels. The manager Josh stated that he remembers me and he was the one who provided them., and claimed erroneously that the towels I asked for this time were MORE than  last week. This wasn't true because I still had to settle for less than last weeks amount. I reminded me we have medical issues. Josh also became somewhat rude to me and had the nerve to ask me ""What do you need all these towels for specifically?"" I said once again that we have medical issues and that should be reason enough. This guy acted like he needed to speak to my doctor or something to get a valid reason why I was asking for some extra towel. We feel that we were  a little discriminated against before we have health issues.,

He said we can give you some more towels( nowhere near the amount I needed)  But if we wanted more, then we would have to give us ALL of the soiled ones FIRST!!. I got tired of arguing and took the towels that he delivered 10 min later.
Also there are no towel hooks in the bathroom  so even if you WANT to reuse a towel, you cant let it dry! Yet this guy expects me to reuse old towels when we need many dry ones.We had to actually hang them off a closet door.

 Other major problem was the room

 We noticed that for some reason the air conditioner wasn't working. We had it on cold at first because when we first arrived the heat was blasting and it felt like an oven in there. It's the middle of winter and we have unseasonably warm days though and so I turned the cold air on for a bit. But later that day  the AC didn't seem to be under the control of the thermostat. It wouldn't turn on/ or off or adjust the temp.e talked the front desk. They send a woman up( not an engineer) who appeared to be in housekeeping- she looked like the head housekeeper I asked if she could fix it- she said she couldn't . She said the engineer wasn't there( this was 6pm on a Friday and they don't have anyone working in case something breaks?!!  This hotel has insufficient staff in the evening it seems.

She also said that we could change rooms. We reluctantly agreed although we were disappointed that we had to.. She left and we packed up  EVERYTHING and got dressed..10 min later, Josh showed up and actually said he knows what the problem is.

There is a wireless thermostat linked to a modified older AC /Heating it by the window( see photo)

Its in a wall near the bathroom between the front door and the rest of the room area(see photo)

The entertainment center/ desk/ dresser drawer console  in the room has a sliding table that can go in and out near a chair so you can do your work.(see photo)
The only problem is that if the table is open or if a chair is blocking the AC( which it easily can) or anything too bulky is on the desk, the signal going from the wireless thermostat to the AC is BLOCKED and will not work!!!

The black sensor  is inside the airvent to the left in the AC ( see photo)
That's what happened then. We had to remove most of our stuff off the table which was inconvenient because we couldn't put things anywhere else in a room that just had a bed, the console, and sofa/chair,

This is a very poor room layout! This is ridiculous!

 It's a wireless  thermostat.!!! It can be placed is a better position so nothing can block the signals. We cant be the first person to have this issue !

Why the person in the front desk didn't know about this was beyond me. Or the housekeeper who came up. Poor training- Very poor indeed.. Only the manager knew the problem and by then we had to repack everything which was a pain.

The hottub was extremely too hot. We have stayed at many other hotels int he area and this was like we were being boiled alive.  We mentioned it to the front desk who said it was only 10",2017-03-19 19:04:32

She then mentioned I should look for another hotel without trying to figure out and fix the issue. This hotel has no customer service and I had to call priceline to resolve the issues since she wouldn't. Priceline resolved the issues and we stayed the night. 

The room was a joke. The hotel was smoke free and all we smell was smoke. There was ashes on the sink and toilet was still dirty. Mattress sheets also had a burned out hole that no one bothered replacing.

Y4yNTKsjm1m_bZpvuxmTdA,xHUwlN187EfH7dbcmCW4cA,TkHED8drwQYycuzFhrVCnA,1,0,0,0,"I stayed here for a single night with co-workers for a work trip.  Although we stayed in separate rooms, we had similar experiences.

The biggest issue is that the rooms were disgusting and filled with bugs.  I had wasps in my toilet (in addition to giant moths, bees, ants, and many gnats throughout the room).  My co-worker had a cockroach in her toilet when she first arrived.  There were dead flies near every light, so they clearly didn't dust or vacuum very often.  The beds, however, were clean.

But the worst part was the room I was staying in had a broken AC.  I reported it at 6pm, and they sent someone out while I was at a work function.  When I returned at 11pm, the AC was still out so I called again and they sent someone out to fix it (who, by the way, was very nice).  I went to sleep (with all the lights on for fear of roaches coming out in the dark) and woke up at 1am sweating because the AC was blowing hot air.  I called the front desk and they said there was no engineer who could fix it given the time of night and offered a different room.  At 1am??  Where was that offer when I reported the two times before?

My co-workers and I checked out first thing in the morning, and the check-out girl was very rude (there was another trainee who was very nice and offered to take off the $25 resort fee).  There manager called me later to apologize and offered a 50% discount (with taxes and fees, the room cost $300).  So basically I paid over $150 for the worst hotel experience of my life.

I will NEVER go here again.  I get that it is a little older of a place and it is Arizona so the occasional insect will appear, but not so many I am afraid to sleep.  I've stayed in nicer freeway motels.  I wanted to tell the nice employees to quit and try working at a better hotel.

Please, please do not go here.  The Paloma is cheaper.  The Marriott is cheaper.  Both are much better hotels.",2018-05-12 23:53:59

Although not a huge issue they have no TV channel guide so you wait several seconds each time you change a channel to see what channels they have and what might be on....irritating.

Fast foward to this past weekend (August) when I returned (daugher's college move in) and could not have been more disappointed.  Not sure if it's a fire regulation or not but the space between the floor and door bottom is HUGE.  Why is that an issue...you can hear every conversation in the hallway by the people who think the world around them wants to hear their every word.  Why are people so rude?  The hotel can't filter out rude people but I do expect my hotel room to get me away from them.  Okay, #2, the room smelled very strong of ""room freshener"" and a bit like cigarettes.  I would bet the previous occupant smoked even though it's a non smoking hotel.  Gross.  #3, the smoke detector was pulled off the wall and hanging by it's wires (previous guest unplugging it?).  #4 Urine stains on the floor around the toilet.  #5 the hot water handle on the sink fell off and was laying on the counter.  No hot water available in the sink.  

After drving 7 hours I was too tired to deal with it and just went to bed...on further reflection I should have changed rooms for the ""freshener"" smell issue.  But I didn't.  Trying to be helpful when I checked out I handed the hot water facet to the front desk...figuring that might get their attention to fix the room.  I told them of all the issues.  They were very nice about it.  I was not looking for anything in return but they offered a discount on my room....they took 20% off.  Not sure how I feel about that...on one hand 20% is better in my pocket than theirs, on the other it seemed a bit ""light""....I would not expect ""free"", after all I did use the room, but I would have thought 50% was more appropriate....but whatever.

PY1OVZ1aFzi5ScoYedVm-Q,CRvqoDqXK_WAHUHuYFt_Pw,zJErbOQMKX-MwHs_ulV7DA,3,0,0,0,"I just stayed here this past weekend for a wedding. I have never been to Philly and don't really know much about it, but I did think the location was pretty nice - it was walking distance to a lot of sight seeing places, and also a ton of bars and restaurants down 2nd street, Walnut and Chestnut. The airport is not too far either, but it is a whopping $28.50 flat fee. I thought the decor inside was really nice too, and the wedding reception/cocktail area was nice. The beds were also super comfortable. I did not go to the pool or the fitness center, so I can't comment on those.....

But now for the negatives:
1. The workers there were generally nice, but the waitresses at the reception were downright rude! they would take my drinks when they were still 1/2 way full without asking if I was done with it and on multiple occasions I was NOT so nicely asked to please move - they pretty much would push me out of the way when there would be plenty of room to just go around me and give a lot of attitude.

2. The price per room is very expensive - it's like it's trying to be fancy, but it really isn't. yes the lobby area is beautifully decorated, but the rest of the hotel is pretty much like any other 3-star hotel. The bar/Taste restaurant is nice too, but the drinks there are ridiculously priced! My husband got 1 beer and I had a vodka soda, and our bill was $20.

3. You have to pay for wi-fi in your room, which is also very expensive ($10 for the whole day I believe), but they do have a business center with free wi-fi. However, I can't comment on it, because the two times we went down there to use a computer it NEVER worked! we would put in our last name and room number like it asked and it would stall for a good long five minutes! and then it would say, ""cannot verify your name or room number"" or something like that.

4. The other thing that SHOULD have been a convenient amenity but wasn't, was the express check out on your TV. I always like to do this if it's an option to, so that I don't have to wait in line at the front desk, but when we went to the TV channel to check out it was completely fuzzy and you couldn't read a thing. Why even have it as an option if it doesn't work??

5. But my biggest complaint is that the walls are SUPER THIN! Both mornings I woke up at 8:30 in the morning to the family next door (two adults and two kids) pretty much screaming and laughing extremely loud. I didn't say anything the first morning, but the 2nd morning I ended up yelling back at them through the wall to shut up. I honestly could hear every single word of their conversation. My friends also shared a wall with a utility closet, so in the middle of the night they kept waking up to clinking and clanking noises coming from it.

Anyway, the hotel did not ruin my experience at the wedding at least - I had an absolute wonderful time celebrating, and if I was ever back in Philly maybe I'd go back, I really don't know. again, i don't know Philly well at all, so I can't really compare it to hotels in the area of its kind. But my complaints above would be something to think about.......",2012-09-03 00:35:49

She was extremely rude and embarrassing me saying I could not stay there, even my boss called to try to get me a room, they were not accommodating at all, she made mean remarks and had extreme attitude, there was a reservation under my name. They didn't even offer to call any other hotels or apologize for the inconvenience... As I said I have been staying there since I was 18 years old.",2015-09-16 14:16:35

Although, it was somewhat entertaining to watch the employees chase it about afterwards. I'm confident most of the rats had a better sense of discretion and kept to the kitchen area. I soon identified a possible food source for the rodents when a large roach scurried across my bathroom floor. I dispatched he beast myself and fortunately had no further encounters. Sadly, several of my work colleagues had a similar experience as well, including one lady that found a rather large one in her towel as she attempted to dry off. It seems a great way to really wake one up in the morning! The general state of disrepair might have been overlooked had it not been for the otherwise horrible experience. Each day that we spent in our corporate meeting was accompanied by constant jack-hammering (and I thought corporate meetings seemed to drag on before! Great life lesson Sheraton!! Well played indeed!) As someone who traveles for a living, being gone from home well over 100 days per year, I do not say this lightly (and I also never fill out these sort of reviews - however on this occasion I feel inspired!) this is one of the worst hotels and hotel experiences I have EVER had and I have had more than a few memorable ones. This definitely makes my top 3 list out of hundreds of stays. My hope is that this place undergoes a serious overhaul or is condemned by the city.

There was no one there and beautiful so we couldn't resist a dip, we ended up swimming for a good 30min before heading back to our room. The guy that checked us in and the one the next day were both very nice, we usually don't require much from staff so either they didn't have the chance to be rude or they fired the ones that were getting complaints. Everyone was friendly, the place was clean, and there is a Starbucks in the lobby! We ended up not doing breakfast there because the menu just wasn't appealing to us. I would def stay here again.

On my last and final stay, I complained to the bellman that the closet door was not on the rails of the closet. He said he would send somebody up to fix the situation. I waited a while but I had to meditate before heading out to dinner with my boss. So, I put up the ""Do Not Disturb Sign"" on my door. The maintenance guy totally ignored the sign and knocked on the door. Then when i did not respond. he had the front desk call me. Total genius.

Then that night there was fire alarm on the loading dock. It was a false alarm and it doesn't sound like there was smoke to go with that fire. I sat out there, with like a hundred of my best friends, for what seemed an eternity, before getting back in my room. All the hotel offered to do was comp me free breakfast, which I did not have time to partake in because I was running late...not enough sleep.

Even if there is no fire alarm the place is noisy. On my first stay, I was off the lobby. The noise bounces into your room from all the people milling about on a marble floor. If your room is closer to the Delaware River, be prepared to hear the highway. I love the roar of a harley at 2am. Zowie!

Unfortunately, they overlooked my request to be put in a room away from the freeway. The noise coming in from the exterior was noticeable. Even with the fan going all night.

Fortunately, the comfortable beds were typical Marriott memory-foam-esque. We had plenty of towels, and pillows. And the room was spotless.

Unfortunately, the bathroom setup was the pits. Dated. The bathroom didn't have a fan, so it was like a sauna in there after my shower. Also, there wasn't a mirror or trash receptacle in the bathroom. Minor inconveniences, that could be easily remedied. But the worst thing was that the sink wasn't in the bathroom! It was located in the hallway, right outside the bathroom itself. It made it impossible for me to be considerate of my traveling companion who wanted to continue sleeping after I got up early to work out.

It was determined that the smell was possibly coming from the vents.  They said they'd check around.  They said they could not determine where it was coming from.   The smell then got worse and it was coming from the door that was adjoining the two rooms.  We called security again.  He then entered the room and also determined that the smell was coming from the next door room.   He knocked on the door and identified himself as security but no one would open the door.  They told us technically if they don't want to answer the door they don't have to.   Really?  This is a no smoking hotel and our room is full of smoke but you're going to allow it because they don't want to answer the door?   They said all they could do was charge them a cleaning fee.

We're not prudes and we're not against partying but when you're traveling with family (including children) the last thing you want to have to deal with is marijuana wafting into your room while you're trying to sleep.

I flew into town for work, and boy did I learn my lesson. I have never been to Tucson so I didn't know the area. I arrived On a Thursday and didn't know that there were so many things happening during my stay, a Reunion, A Football Game AND Parents Weekend, everyplace was boomed! 
I was lucky to find a hotel for $50 a night, what a great deal!! I booked 1 night because I thought I might be able to find a place closer to Downtown, where I had to work, I did not, haha. 
Well, to start off the story, I had booked 1 night at America's Best Value Inn, about 10-15 minutes away from where I needed to be. 
I arrived in Tucson a little around 2pm, got an Uber to my hotel. The Uber Driver proceeds to tell me (the very first thing he says) that it's not in the best neighborhood, to not go out at night unless I get a car to drive me either a Taxi, Uber or Lyft. I laughed and asked him how is the hotel that I'm staying at, he then says, ""Well it's better the _______"" (Which was across the street and I'm blanking on the name) he says he picked up a woman who works at housekeeping at the hotel who's name I'm blanking on and she then continues to tell him that they don't change the sheets. That they just make the bed once a customer leaves and don't change the sheets. She told him that the only time they actually fully cleaned the room was when a customer shot himself IN the room.....but not to worry, because my hotel was across the street. Holy crap! Haha

Well, after a series of unfortunate events that took place at America's Best Value Inn, which included rude staff, questionable stains on the bed and the previous customers' short and curly. 
That Thursday night I had called Quality Inn and spoke to a lovely older woman and I believe her name was Mary Ellen or something close to that. I told her where I was currently staying and the horrors I witnessed and went through and told her that I had bought and paid for my stay for the rest of the weekend at their hotel. I told her that I had to check out at 11am at my current hotel and that I knew that check in at their hotel was at 3pm, but if it were possible to have an early check in. She totally understood what I went through and knew of the history of the hotel that I was currently staying in and said to just mention that I had spoken to her and that if there was a room already ready that they'd let me check in early or if not, then I could leave my bags at the front desk and go do what I needed to do to then return and check into my room. 
I check out of the shit hole I had stayed in the night before and got to the Quality Inn, I was familiar with the hotel as I have stayed in plenty of Quality Inns before. 
I was greeted by Sam and another Employee who was sweet as can be! Sam took care of me and was able to get me a room at just a little passed 11am and I was able to check into my room and relax for a moment. The rest of the stay was great!

I gave her a brief description of my issued and told her if she is not willing to help to please give me her Managers name and she gave me Mikes name without any assistance. What is the worse... is that she didn't offer to get the bed made, dusted, additional towels brought, etc.
Hopefully Mike will rectify this... more to come.",2017-06-25 22:44:38

While visiting Philly to drop off a family member to college we decided to stay at Hyatt Place. The room looked half cleaned with small trash all over the carpet and our extra pillow had a burn hole in it. We stayed here for 5 days and our hotel room was cleaned ONLY ONE TIME! There was five of us staying in the room and everyday we had to hassle the front desk for clean towels (half the time the towels we were given had stains on them). We also bought a mini fridge for the college dorm, but when we arrived the elevators were out of order. We were told they would place our mini fridge in a closet, so we would not have to worry about taking it up to the 5th floor. But hours later when we came back down it was just sitting in the lobby. !!!!VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!

THE HOTEL IS NOT COVID SAFE!
Although , there is a sign in the front lobby stating face mask are required, many did not wear them. Multiple clients walked in and out with no face mask without being questioned by staff. The woman who I assume is the manager of the hotel also did not wear a face mask, and when she did have one it was sitting on her chin!",2020-08-30 19:28:42

We stayed August 6-8 and the stay was nice as Hyatt place is one of my favorite hotels.  This was our first stay at this particular hotel.  We got up Saturday morning and went to get a breakfast bag from the front desk.  ""Robert"" didn't greet us so I asked if they had breakfast bags available and coffee.   He said yes but they were just bagels.  I said that's fine can I and my girlfriend get a bag.  He looks me up and down and asks if we are even staying there.  That was the first mistake but I said yes we are.  He hands me the bags and coffee, I said thank you and no response from him.  Then upon check out I go to the front desk and tell him I'd like to take the hold off of my credit card and charge the room to my debit card and hand him the card.  He then says he needs to see my ID.  I ask why do you need to see my ID when I'm checking out?  He looks and asks me ""are you even Nicole?""  Second mistake, but yes I am Nicole and you see the card matches the name for the room.  He said ""I can't complete the transaction without seeing your ID.""   At this point I'm getting very angry and very appalled at the way he's acting.  I asked him why he didn't ask the man for his ID earlier when I was getting breakfast.  He acted like he didn't know what I was talking about and I told him there was a guy checking out earlier who paid you and not one time did you ask for his ID so why are you asking for mine.  It wouldn't be apparent that I have a stolen debit card when the room is in my name and the debit card is in my name so what's the reason for asking me versus anyone else because that's not a typical policy when someone is checking out as I've stayed at Hyatt many many times.  I'm sure he was stereotyping or possibly profiling but I do not take kindly to that type of treatment nor will I tolerate it.  I will be contacting the corporate office as this behavior should stop and if he cannot treat all patrons the same then he should not work the front desk.  The stay here was good up until that day of both encounters with Robert.  He has left a very very bad taste in my mouth with regard to Hyatt place.

I'll say that the renovations were nice... and that's about all this place has going for it.  My biggest problem were the amenities in this hotel (or lack thereof).  I assume this Sheraton chooses to charge all of its guests for every little thing because of their location, but it's a really big pain.  Let's break it down.

Pros:
+ Nice, remodeled rooms
+ Fitness center with high-end equipment (though small)
+ Nice pool 
+ Free USA Today available Monday-Friday
+ In-Room Starbucks Coffee 
+ Small Starbucks in lobby (expensive, though)

Cons:
- Base rate is $189+ tax (and rooms aren't big)
- Nice pool full of annoying kids from 6 a.m. - 10 p.m.
- Paid WiFi ($9.95/day) - I'm sorry, but why is WiFi free at Days Inn but it's not here?  There are other Sheraton's in the city of Philadelphia that have FREE WIFI... but you don't?  Unbelievable and highly, highly irritating.  Your patrons appreciate free WiFi, trust me.
- Slow, slow service.  When requesting more coffee (there was only enough for one person), it took two or three phone calls to actually get someone to come upstairs.  Coffee (and other toiletries and things) were never refilled during cleaning service in the morning.  What's the point of the coffee, then?  
- Rude front desk service.  When WiFi was free for the first two days we were there and then paid after, I called to complain.  What is the deal with that?  How is there just not free WiFi?  The front desk attendant didn't care about anything that I had to say and was actually rude about customer suggestions.  She told me there was nothing their hotel would do about these situations and there was no one else I could speak with to discuss the matter.  I know she was lying, but her rudeness made me want to get off the phone immediately.
- Super expensive in-house restaurant.  Standard breakfast was $13.  Oatmeal was $9.  Yogurt + bagel was $10.  Dinner entrees were $20+ and the food was pretty mediocre.  You're better off walking one block north on 2nd Street and going to any one of dozens of restaurants in the area.
- Lack of amenities for conference goers.  Most other hotels/resorts offer free WiFi to conferences that use the facilities and we got nothing.  No free coffee service in the morning, no free WiFi, no places to sit/stand to do work... nothing.  I've been to other conferences in other hotels and they definitely offer their guests much, much more in terms of amenities.

Don't come here.  The rooms are way too expensive for their lack of 20th century remodeling and amenities.  I'd say stay anywhere else (like the Hyatt down the block) if you want to stay somewhere large.  This hotel is not worth your time or your money.",2010-07-13 01:24:53

Well, we prepaid for a room, got stuck driving from Oregon without cell signal and arrived at 1:30am to be told by Jon that the computers are purged of reservations at midnight and we no longer have a room.  I asked about the fact that I prepaid and he said I would be refunded.  I asked if I could re purchase the room
And he said no.  I went next door to the Marriot where a wonderful woman helped
Me try to find a new room.  Every place was booked.  Now we Are driving to truckee (which is entirely in the wrong direction of our trip so that we have some place to sleep.  I called Jon back to ask his name so that I could discuss with the manager tomorrow and he said he was instructed to delete the reservations, and when I asked who instructed him so that I could call and talk to a manager tomorrow he hung up on me.

Update - the interactions with staff at this place have progressed to bizarre.  I called this morning to talk to a manager and was told
That no manager was there and she didn't know when a manager would be on site.  She asked if she could help, I said that probably wasn't a good idea due to how upset I was, she asked again so I began telling her about what happened.  Her demeanor became immediately defensive as she explained their policy of canceling reservations at midnight, when I tried to stop her to interject that no where in my confirmation was I notified of  that policy, she snapped at me and was super condescending about interrupting her.  Which of course made me angry.  I'm tired, I'm frustrated and I'm trying to ask for the situation to be rectified as I was charged for the room that I did not get to use and I was met with defensive attitude.  When I told her I thought she was being rude she hung up on me.  I called back, pointed out that was not professional and that now I planned to escalate the issue and she hung up on me again.  I tried calling again, she told me she wouldn't talk to me if I did t calm down, so I tried to meter my anger  and asked how I get a refund, her response ""I don't know, however you booked it you need to deal with them"". She refused to listen every time I pointed out booking directly through their website.  I pointed out I didn't appreciate how she was speaking to me, which only resulted in her ending the call again.  I wanted to know when I would be refunded and why the policy of late arrival cancellation was not included in my reservation and she refused to give me an answer just stating that it's their policy and my fault for not calling to let them know we would be late.  Was I angry, yes.  Was I interrupting her, after her flippant response to deflect responsibility, yes.  I was not rude or mean, I was frustrated at the lack of customer service or a desire to help me sort it out.  That's not how you resolve a problem.  After now being hung up on by 2 employees I decided to call Hilton directly as there are clear management issues and my situation was not going to be resolved.  

After hours on hold and 2 separate agents helping me both tried calling the hotel to speak to the manager and were lied to by the employee I spoke to.  First she told them the manager was there, heard our conversation and said I was the rude one, then told the second agent that I had spoke directly to the manager and it had been resolved.  Neither of which are true. And if the manager had been there during our call, why wouldn't they have stepped in to help me.  

This is not how you resolve things.  Hilton agents were kind enough but until my room is refunded my review stands and all I can say is bad management like this can ruin a reputation.  

What would have made a difference?  Compassion, a willingness to try and help the resolve the problem.  But they were incapable.  And now the Marriot next door has set the example for how they should have handled this.  

I just wanted someone to say, we are so sorry this happened and how can we help.  Instead I got ""it's your fault, not our problem"".",2021-06-25 09:26:07

I was borderline assaulted after asking for his name and writing it down on a piece of paper. He literally snatched it from my hand and told me to complain to management tomorrow.

Smoke-free? The place reeks of cigarette smoke and despair. It was difficult trying to sleep with all of the marijuana smoke pouring under the joining door. As if that wasn't bad enough, the noise level in this place was a cross between a schoolhouse at recess & a construction zone.

As for accommodations, it's all broken & mildewed. Pack your Lysol & Clorox.

The hotel was so elegant looking, we were greeted by the front desk every time we came in to the hotel and our rooms were so much better than anything any other hotel had. Oh how I miss those days!
This hotel is a newer hotel, located in a prime spot just off the PA Turnpike (NE extension Lansdale exit) and has a nice large parking lot that is free. The lobby of the hotel was beautifully decorated for the holiday and had a table with gingerbread houses made by some of the staff. There is a long banquette in front of the TV with a beautiful gas fireplace. There is a sort of dining area where you can sit for the breakfast you pay for since it isn't included (when did this stop?). The rooms are very modern with sleek appliances and a sort of coffee station with a very small fridge below.
Why then am I only giving this 3 stars? If not for the newness and modernity I would be giving it 2 stars. The treatment was severely lacking. When we checked in, the guy checking us in was on the rude side. We were given the feeling that we had interrupted his contemplation of his navel lint and he resented that.
Then there are the beds. The pillows were like rejects from a lesser quality hotel in that they were very flat & lumpy at the same time. The sheets on my bed didn't have the necessary elastic in order to meet the definition of a 'fitted' sheet and I woke with all of the sheets wrapped around me and I was sleeping on a bare mattress.
The maid service was something where much was left to be desired. Yes, it was the holiday weekend and had she been nicer or the hotel more accommodating then maybe we would've agreed to not having maid service on Christmas Day. It was like I wanted to tell her that smiling isn't a crime. She was very grumpy. Additionally, my sheets weren't changed, she just made the bed. How do I know this? Unless Marriott invested in fitted sheets with broken elastic, then I had the exact same non-fitted sheet on my bed for the entire stay. There was no vacuuming, no dusting and there is NO WAY you can tell me that they followed Covid cleaning because of included picture with the rust stain bleeding from the hand rail in our shower that got longer & longer each day. I wiped it with a face towel my last day & left it on the counter...shock! It was easily wiped!
The last thing, and yes, it WAS a holiday weekend so I'm more forgiving for this. When we opened our drapes, there in the center of the window was this very large deposit of bird feces. What a joy to look at every day!

First, the bathtub in my room was not draining properly, so by the end of my shower I was standing in a foot of water. 

Second, the door lock broke so none of my room keys worked. My room was a long walk from the elevator (the very end of a very long hallway), so I spent a solid half hour walking back and forth from my room to reception trying to get a key that would work. That was my only half hour of downtime for the day (I was here on business), and I never did get into my room before I had to head out for my next obligation. 

Third, when I got back to the hotel later that evening, I finally made it inside my room only to discover that housekeeping had never come by. The tub was full of grime because the water took hours to drain from my shower, the bed wasn't made, no new towels, etc. I had NOT left anything on the door saying they should skip my room, so I am at a loss for why they didn't tidy. Especially since that morning, I had heard housekeeping going room-to-room at a rudely early hour (7:45 a.m.!)

The hassle came with the 23 dollar  ""resort charge"" for items and exclusives that we did not even use. When the nice man at the checkout desk ran our debit card, he did not mention this wonderful extra charge. In fact, he even went so far as to show us our total (which did not include this charge) on his cute little calculator. So as you can imagine, we were surprised when we checked our account, that we had been charged this money.

When we went to talk to the front desk in the morning concerning these charges, the concierge was quite nice. He tried to be sympathetic and told us a story about how Hilton screwed him over with ""small print charges"" on a recent vacation he had taken. Uh...that's well and good, but that doesn't help us get our money back. When he went to get the manager, we expected a courteous, understanding, respectful professional, but unfortunately, we received Defense-o: The Mega Grump. 

First off, she did not even look at me: the adorable wife. She introduced herself to my husband, shaking his hand. It was extremely weird.  When we explained our debacle, she instantly became defensive. She asked, ""Sir, have you ever even STAYED at a resort before?"" Although I was able to keep myself from thwaping her in the throat, if you look very closely at the counter, my frustrated finger nail scratches remain today. The only thing that was missing was her snapping her fingers several times in front of herself. When we mentioned that we did not see the small print associated with the charge on the website she said, ""Well, sir...don't you read contracts that are put in front of you?"" Remember, she was saying these things in the most condescending tone you could ever imagine. When we brought up that the guy at the checkout counter never mentioned the charge when he gave us the list of ""resort exclusives"", she actually interrupted me and said, ""I can guarantee my agent did not do that."" Really? Can you? Because if he had, we would probably not be there, arguing over a stupid charge with a woman who had about as much customer service savvy as an old, offensive sock. 

Now, we are reasonable people, yes. If this manager had only said, ""Hey, I'm really sorry for this misunderstanding, it happens a lot, but it is a standard charge yatta yatta"" it would have calmed us a bit and we could have moved on with our lives. But no. This manager (I shudder even saying the word, as such word would indicate a certain level of customer service) decided to make us seem like poor, irritating scum from the bottom of the social classes. 

And that, my friends, is why we will never stay at that hotel again; because of one defensive, rude, little manager. If this is the level of professionalism that Hilton expects from its managers, I weep for their future. I so hope she learns to keep her rude comments to herself, be apologetic, and try to calmly explain Hilton's policies rather than making the guests feel like idiots.

I felt belittled and incompetent especially in front of the other customers checking in. 

The morning we checked out I called the front desk to ask about the pick-up times for the airport shuttle and was told it left every 30 mins. I then prepared to leave on the 9am shuttle. I arrived in the hotel lobby at approximately 8:52am and was told the 9am shuttle had already departed.

She didn't even offer an apology for not communicating the appropriate info and only suggested we wait until 9:30am for the next shuttle. I then had to pay $12 for a taxi to the airport.

Two of my girlfriends and I stayed here in the summer of 2011. I booked on Hotels.com and the reviews there weren't bad. We wanted to stay in the city but this hotel offered a better price with a short drive to the places we wanted to visit. When we arrived we were pleased with our room; it was spacious and clean looking. There was a big bed for two of us, and a couch for one more. I think the couch was a pullout, but being on the short side, I was able to sleep on it without opening it. It was pretty comfortable. The bed was extremely comfortable.

Despite the comfort, we did not get any sleep at all. There were several rooms rented out by kids. Many of them did not even seem to be 18 years old. They were making extremely loud noise in the hallways and in their rooms all night long. The room next door to us had the double joining doors, I could hear right through them. We called the front desk to complain. The noise continued. After a half hour, I tried calling the front desk again but the power was out, including the phones. I went to the front desk and the woman behind the counter was EXTREMELY helpful. She was apologetic, understanding and kind. She told one of the security guards about the issue and said that if they keep up the noise, they will have to leave the hotel. When my friend and I went back to our room, the halls were quiet because most of the kids went out to smoke. However, my friend being frustrated started telling one of the lingering kids that they need to keep quiet, and it's late at night, etc. We went to our room. When the kids came back, a different security guard came up and said he didn't hear any noise when he came up but walked by and saw us making commotion with the kid across the hall. We are in our late 20's. Why on earth would we be starting a fight with a bunch of teenagers?! He was completely rude to us and told us there was no noise. When the kids came back from smoking, the security guard wouldn't come help us. He was also rude to the concierge. I think he was either racist or sexist because the concierge was a woman; she and my friend and I are all not white.

If you want to skip everything I wrote, read this: Horrible experience with staff. Also, my friend found a bed bug upon returning home. Luckily she found it and killed it before it infested her life. Don't stay at Hilton Philadelphia Airport. HORRIBLE.",2012-06-06 15:28:22

I'm rounding up, 'cause Wyndham is awesome in everything it does.  And no, I never worked here, so I'm less biased than Steph and Catherine.

Wyndham, as a whole, kicks ass, no two ways about it.  It's absolutely beautiful inside, the servers are always polite, friendly and accommodating, the menu is widely varied but always delicious and reasonably priced, and they'll make you a damn stiff drink if you want it.

Did I mention the whole place is ridiculously clean?  And pretty?  Well, it is.  The business lunches and alumnae ""events"" I've done in Wyndham (AKA Wyndham Alumnae House AKA Wyndham Bed and Breakfast) have been highlights of my adult life.  I just feel so sophisticated when I'm in there, I can't help it.

Wyndham also hosts many of the College's esteemed visiting poets and authors. The Ely room is a wonder to behold: I saw Mary Gaitskill read here.  I saw Robinson Jeffers read here.  I saw Olga Grushin read here.  And I am so lucky.  (It's so lovely that couples often choose to be married or have their receptions in the Ely room!)

So why am I giving the hotel only four stars?  Personal preference for the rooms.  They're rather small, and they remind me of my great grandmother's house.  They're kind of dark, a little stuffy, and the floorboards creak. I realize that this is exactly what most B&Bs are going for, but Wyndham is so elegant in all other regards that I couldn't help but find myself wanting a little more polish in the rooms.  What can I say?  I'm a Bryn Mawrtyr - I have high standards.  But once I settled into the bed there, I was won over.  The sheets!  The down comforter!  The mattress that is soft yet supportive!

D64bn150ZxJzOsCEPCLmSQ,Dhfb_rj1Bvf6211gCj7i2Q,9PXJkRLVWd6IMPfBzdJp2Q,1,6,3,3,"This hotel is located in the Oro Valley just outside northern Tucson AZ.

The grounds are small and beautiful. Strictly a four-star. If you decide to stay there, ask for an east-facing room with view of the Catalina Mtns. Very picturesque. 

I am comparing the El Conquistador to the four-star Desert Springs Resort in Palm Desert which is simply stunning in nearly all categories. I am also comparing it to the amazing five-star Ventana Inn in Big Sur CA, which I have also stayed at recently. 

The problem with the Tucson resort hotels such as the El Conquistador and Loew's Ventana Canyon Resort (on the east side of Tucson) is that you are going to run into the wannabes such as we have had the misfortune of doing. This will also happen in Scottsdale such as at the Scottsdale Resort. You're going to have to either stay at a ""road warrier"" place or at a resort in Paradise Valley such as the Sanctuary.

Recent example at the El Conquistador: we stayed there over the Thanksgiving 2009 weekend and although many of the guests are polite and considerate, the wannabes (aka ""$30k millionaires"") are also out in force there acting loudly arrogant, inconsiderate, and resorting to bully tactics on very short notice. I'm not sure how they can afford to stay at a four-star, but apparently they do. 

In our case, we had to use the Business Center computers (2) there because we had to conduct several transactions online using a secure server. This included banking transactions and other transactions involving use of our cc number. To use our laptop (we bring it with us) would not have been advisable since wireless keystrokes can be picked up by anyone in the vicinity, thus risking hackers.

Anyway, 2 very rude and inconsiderate women looking like Dollar Store shoppers showed up about 4 minutes after we entered the Business Center, and stood directly behind me - which to a reasonable person, would put them in plain view of my screen since the screens there do not have a privacy shield. 

I turned around in my seat and politely let them know we had just arrived and would need time to be able to finish up. The younger of the two rudely commented that ""we're going to stay here"" or words to that effect, as though she was concerned about keeping her place in line where no one else was waiting to come in. As though this hotel is the sort of place one would need to worry about that! 

An older couple entered in about 10 mins later, and were rudely told by this young woman (late-twenties) that they were ""still waiting since these people were supposed to be gone by now."" The older couple did the upper-class thing and left, stating they would return later.

Which if these two females had done, we would have been out of there by then since we would not have had to delay performing our necessary tasks having to wait for them to leave, since politely informing them of our situation did no good. 

This situation is the 2nd bad experience I have had at this hotel. 

The first was earlier in Spring 2009 where a couple in the room next to us began fighting verbally which devolved into a series of physical attacks upon each other. 

I guess other guests called the concierge to alert them since I received a call from the concierge inquiring about noise or other disturbance I may be hearing. (Are you shocked? There's more....)

I let the concierge know that I was hearing sounds of a physical fight going on in the room next door and I was embarrassed to state this since I have never encountered anything like this in a hotel or anywhere else.

Anyway, she notified hotel security and two officers came up to the room in question, and conducted a room search. I could even hear them opening the drapes all the way and going out on the balcony to search for additional participants. 

The fighting couple left a couple of hours later or were asked to leave, not sure which, but they left.

So, I have had two bad experiences with this place and will not be returning.

Loew's Ventana Canyon (not to be confused with the Ventana Inn in Big Sur) is worse since they feature ""Girls Night Out"" events which encourages the wannabes to stay there. 

This is what the wannabes do: gang together in small groups and split the cost of a room four ways in order to afford it. They then party loudly all night long and goof off in the pool area. Their low-budget conduct is derived from the TV show ""Sex and the City"" which is the Mother Ship of behavior standards for the wannabes.

The five stars such as the Arizona Biltmore do not participate in this sort of thing. Neither does Canyon Ranch in Tucson. These resorts/spas are fully aware of the wannabes and know what to do to keep them out.

I'm sorry, but I cannot rec this place to anyone seeking a resort experience.",2009-11-30 19:53:07

Two nights of the stay there was a guest in the next room playing music loudly that kept us up.  The front desk could care less and told us to call the police.

I sent an email to the general manager and did not hear back, so I called the 800 number and they took my complaint.

However, I feel that customer service plays a huge role in the quality of a hotel. My parents were not impressed either and not very happy with the customer service.",2013-09-17 15:02:22

I was promised a hospitality room for all my bridesmaids to get ready in. For 2 months before the wedding I had the joy of dealing with Kiana and Tom who are the most incompetent unprofessional people I have ever met in my life. Nick was trying to help by giving us a regular hotel room and emptied the furniture out so I had a place to get ready. The morning of the wedding my mother walked down to the front desk to check in her room early and Kiana was standing by the front desk and my mom said you're the one who screwed up my daughters wedding.... Kiana proceeded to tell my mother the morning of my wedding ""you don't know what the F**k you're talking about"" in an extremely aggressive manner.  My mom was horrified and came to get my sister and I to witness this. My sister had her camera recording everything and Kiana processed to rip her jacket off as if she was going to fight us. I had to twice jump Infront of her so she wouldn't put her ghetto hands on my sister. She knocked the phone out of her hand twice. Tom witnessed all of this and continues to let Kiana stay. I don't know about you but any job I ever had if u physically threaten guests you are fired immediately and asked to leave the premises. Nope not at best western!  The police were called and I had to have the police in my room while getting hair and makeup. They were horrified at the incident and said that the footage clearly showed how insane and crazy Kiana was. I will be contacting our attorney to see what we can do about this.   It doesn't end there They also promised me a private bar that I paid $60 extra for to be open until 2am the night of my wedding. As we were waiting for our trolley to arrive the manager let us know we are not getting a bar area and we can get our drinks and go outside. This was something they had no problem taking our money for ahead of time and failing to come through on. They then said we'll the bar is open to anyone. So we went into the bar area where the other bridal party who paid extra as well were annoyed that we were there and proceeded to scream
At our party that we shouldn't be there. This potentially could have been a nightmare. We were later able to talk to one of the other bridesmaids and the bride n groom and explain situation and they were just as horrified and disgusted over their experience. I hope this never happens to another bride!!! If I have any advice please DO NOT EVER STAY HERE. There is so much more. The room was 90* with no AC the night before my wedding so I had zero sleep and the weeks leading up to the wedding Kiana had hung up on me and screamed at me multiple times all bc I was trying to pay for my shuttle service for guests from
Hotel to venue. BEWARE AND STAY FAR AWAY.  TOM AND KIANA I WILL MAKE SURE EVERYONE KNOWS HOW HORRENDOUS YOU ARE.  Ps- your staff thinks your just as awful and begged me to do whatever I can so corporate can be aware of how horrible u are to ur employees too!!!!!!!!!",2017-07-06 22:36:53

Cockroach in my co-worker's toilet, wasp in mine.  Not to mention the moths, ants, and dead flies near every light.  Clearly they don't dust or vacuum often enough.

The beds were clean, but I honestly slept with all the lights on for fear of roaches coming out.  Most of the staff was really rude and incredibly slow (30 minutes to check in and out with no line).  There was a trainee at the front desk who was very nice and helpful, but I forgot her name.

My AC was broken so I called to have it fixed at 6pm, 11pm and 1am.  Although the tech came out to fix it the first two times and was nice, the hotel did not offer to switch me rooms until 1am.

Terrible customer service, terrible conditions. I would never go back - for $300 a night I could have stayed at a much nicer hotel and just driven to the event.  Save yourself the experience.",2018-05-17 14:08:21

TpyKmCGHWt6HLvFltYZgVA,Dhfb_rj1Bvf6211gCj7i2Q,9PXJkRLVWd6IMPfBzdJp2Q,1,19,9,9,"This hotel is located in the Oro Valley just outside northern Tucson AZ.

The grounds are small and beautiful. Strictly a four-star. If you decide to stay, ask for an east-facing room with a view of the Catalina Mtns. 

The problem with hotels such as the El Conquistador and Loew's Ventana Canyon Resort is that you are going to run into the ""wannabes"" such as we have had the misfortune of doing. This will also happen in places such as Scottsdale like the Scottsdale Resort. You're going to have to either stay at a ""road warrier"" hotel or at a resort in Paradise Valley.

Recent example at the El Conquistador: we stayed there over the Thanksgiving 2009 weekend and although many of the guests are polite and considerate, the wannabes (aka ""$30k millionaires"") are also out in force acting loudly arrogant, inconsiderate, and resorting to bully tactics on very short notice. I'm not sure how they can afford to stay at a four-star, but apparently they do.

In our case, we had to use the Business Center computers (2) there because we had to conduct several transactions online using a secure server. This included banking transactions and other transactions involving use of our cc number. To use our laptop (we bring it with us) would not have been advisable since wireless keystrokes can be picked up by anyone in the vicinity, thus risking hackers. Note: there is a $10.00 fee for wireless connection in  your room - not a problem unless you need to use passcodes or cc numbers.

Anyway, 2 very rude and inconsiderate women looking like Dollar Store shoppers showed up about 4 minutes after we entered the Business Center, and stood directly behind me - which to a reasonable person, would put them in plain view of my screen since the screens there do not have a privacy shield.

I turned around in my seat and politely let them know we had just arrived and would need time to be able to finish up. 

The younger of the two rudely commented that ""we're going to stay here"" or words to that effect, as though she was concerned about keeping her place in line where no one else was waiting. 

I got the distinct impression that she was angry that they found us there first.

Her behavior was out of place and digitally ignorant of a user's need for cyber privacy. 

An older couple entered in about 10 mins later, and were rudely told by one woman (late-twenties) that they were ""still waiting since these people were supposed to be gone by now."" The older couple did the upper-class thing and left, stating they would return later.

Which if these two females had done, we would have been out of there by then since we would not have had to delay performing our necessary tasks having to wait for them to leave, since politely informing them of our situation did no good.

This situation is the 2nd & last bad experience I have had at this hotel. 

The first was earlier in Spring 2009 where a couple in the room next to us began fighting verbally which devolved into a series of physical attacks upon each other.

I guess other guests called the front desk since I received a call from staff inquiring about noise or other disturbance I may be hearing. (Are you shocked? There's more....)

I let the staffperson know that I was hearing sounds of a physical fight going on in the room next door and I was embarrassed to state this since I have never encountered anything like this in a hotel or anywhere else.

Anyway, she notified hotel security and two officers came up to the room in question, and conducted a room search. I could even hear them opening the drapes all the way and going out on the balcony to search for additional participants.

The fighting couple left a couple of hours later or were asked to leave, not sure which, but they left.

So, I have had two bad experiences at this place and will not be returning.

Loew's Ventana Canyon (not to be confused with the Ventana Inn in Big Sur) is worse since they feature ""Girls Night Out"" events which encourages the wannabes to stay there.

This is what the wannabes do: gang together in small groups and split the cost of a room four ways in order to afford it. They then party loudly all night long and goof off in the pool area. Their low-rent conduct is derived from the TV shows ""Sex and the City,""  ""Dallas Divas & Daughters"" and ""Real Housewives of Wherever"" which are the Mother Ships of behavior standards for the wannabes.

The five stars such as the Arizona Biltmore do not participate in this sort of thing. Neither does Canyon Ranch in Tucson. These resorts/spas are fully aware of the wannabes and know what to do to keep them out.

I'm sorry, but I cannot rec this place to anyone seeking a pleasant resort experience.",2009-11-30 20:12:08

Only reason for 3 stars is the breakfast staff... well first  - if you're going to have hot sausage/bacon whatever - you'd think they could manage scrambled eggs or some such. The stone cold hard-boiled egg didn't really cut it. Yes they did have a waffle maker but  it takes an interminable length of time and well waffles aren't  the most practical thing for hot breakfast....

The real kicker was the information book(s) in the room stated clearly that the breakfast was open until 10 on weekends AND holidays. Got down there Monday Labor Day at 9:20 and the breakfast attendant stated it was closing at 9:30. We inquired about the 10 a.m. stated in the books and we were told (quite rudely) we were wrong - they always closed at 9:30 on weekdays. Of the 10 guests that came down about the same time most had read the 10 a.m.  and were a little miffed. We went to the front desk to alert them to the inconsistency and the response was ""huh, I didn't know that"", and shortly thereafter crash bang the doors were closed. 

I can only hope that one of the upset guests who stated they were the manager of another marriott property can influence the operations of this one.",2014-09-04 16:49:35

First I was ignored while one of the two clerks was focused on trying to force some paperwork into a binder, all the while chattering to the other one who was checking someone in. When she finally decided to greet me and check me in, she picked up a filthy wad of tissue in one hand and continually wiped her nose. That same hand was the one used to pick up and hand me my id, credit card and room key, while the  tissue was still in it.  Ugh. Oh, and she hummed along with the lobby music the entire time she was checking me in.  I guess that way she could prove she wasn't paying attention to the client.  Tacky.

 The room was decently furnished, but not clean, and the bathroom had guck stuck in the corners in the bathtub. Fingerprints all over the furniture in the bedroom. Really cheap pillows on otherwise decent bed.  The glasses in the bathroom felt as though they had been cleaned with furniture spray. 

To make matters worse, I walked out and left some clothes on the second, and unused, bed. It was early, I was groggy, it was my fault.  I only had one small bag with me and only one change of clothes which I was wearing. When I called about the clothes the housekeeping manager was very testy with me, insisting that I must have left them tangled in the sheets. In any case, no one turned them in.  They were not on my body, in my car, or in the small carryon I had. I hope the person who has them is cursed when wearing them. How awful to sell your integrity for so little.

To make matters even worse, my two calls to the managers were not retiurned.  I left messages just asking to be called back with no mention of the problem, just that I wanted to talk about a situation during my stay.

The managers I left messages for never called me back, but a wonderful fellow named Michael Riccio called me a week later. He is a new manager who happened to see this review and immediately called.  He found my clothing and is sending it back.  I hope he is successful in getting this place up to standard.  If the entire staff were like him, all would be well.

Back story: we called because my girlfriend has spent 15k at Hilton last year alone about negotiating a room rate. Not rare when you're a diamond member. Considering we have several hotels booked for Ohio that have easily accommodated us. First, we were put on hold for 20 minutes and forgotten about. So we call back and get the General Manager on the phone. The above quote was her answer due to a power outage. Didn't offer to take a phone number and name and have her staff call us. Instead just didn't have time and to call back tomorrow during the hours the sales team is available. Her tone was completely snippy and disrespectful. 

So being a Diamond member we call the desk. That was last Monday. Funny the note of complaint was sent to the General Manager of this Hotel and she has yet not called to deal with her own complaint. I can't imagine why? She clearly isn't capable of being a General Manager at this hotel and corporate will be well aware of her too. 

Hilton is one of the grander hotels to stay at. It is a-shame that they have allowed this caliber of an employee to totally disrespect the Hilton name.

They had a Christmas party so all those guests took up hotel parking. We parked out back, I mean waaaaaay out back in the dirt. Then hiked in and it was freezing. Cutting through the hotel would have made our trip to the front desk shorter but without a key we had to walk all the way around. 30 minutes later with bags in hand and very dusty, we were not only hungry but pretty cranky.

We went in to the room. It didn't stink and the plumbing worked. At first the television didn't but after 10 minutes of warming up it finally came on. Knowing I had to get up very early we decided we'd just stay there. This room too looked pretty run down and definitely in need of a fresh coat of paint but it would do. In the morning when I went to check out, out of habit I said ""Thank you"" and all I got was ""you're welcome"". Wait I thanked them for letting me spend money in there run down hotel with poor service? Seemed a bit backwards. The person at the front desk never managed a smile and certainly couldn't be bothered to say thank you.  Pretty dismal.  I would have rated it a one star but the fabulous meal in the restaurant was the only bright spot in a pretty nasty stay.  I can see why they could care less about the marathoners, it seems the only game in town. The marathon brings in a lot of people and few hotels in the area are large enough to accommodate them.  So I guess the Hilton just doesn't care.",2015-12-19 20:29:16

This has been my favorite ""secret"" jem, but because of the new staff at the front desk I am currently looking for a new place to stay in the Reno area. I have not yet reached 20 stays or whatever it takes for a free room, but I certainly must be close! I have enjoyed every visit here for sleeping purposes. My family was safe , breakfast wonderful, easy on/off freeway, and prices were acceptable. I see this changing. However, I refuse to be treated the way I was at the front desk yesterday. Although the girl challenged me to find some other place, I am here. After planning ahead, travelling with a small dog, and driving 7 hours I am not going to bend to the whims of a rude unprofessional disorganized ""kid"" running a huge facility. Just because it is 5 o'clock doesn't mean you bring out your worst employees. Never have I been treated so rudely. While I tried to complain she talked incessantly on the telephone, and was truly rude and not doing her job. The dining area was full of people I guess waiting for rooms. Pickup trucks (two) parked in the registration area for 20 minutes+. I am handicapped and love this place because of the wonderful way in which they have always taken care of me. The staff has always been courteous and helpful, but not today. Perhaps the fact that this girl had the entire front desk covered with ""employment packages"" is a clue. When I tried to work with her and even challenge her to wait on me without getting into a 5 minute phone conversation with an inquiry into reservations for the future, when a paying guest is waiting to check in...well her response was to interrupt me and invite me to stay elsewhere. My room, ( which was not handicap accessible ) was in such a popular area, that with 7 parking places available for two rooms ( mine and 1 other room) every single parking place was taken. I believe there was a party going on! Watch for this place to go down hill very quickly. So sad.",2014-07-25 14:16:11

This hotel was recently built so you can expect everything to look new and clean. We had a spacious room on the third floor that overlooked the beautiful snow capped mountains. Breakfast was available from 6-10am daily and offered a wide selection that included eggs, meat, fresh fruit, oatmeal, pastries, and drinks. The staff was very friendly and personable and willing to help with all of our requests. The freeway was easily accessible and the perfect distance between downtown and Northstar. There is ample parking in the front and back of the hotel with two reserved parking stalls for Diamond members. One of my favorite aspects of the hotel was the availability of coffee and tea in the lobby 24/7. I would definitely come back to this hotel if I ever frequent the area again.",2016-02-22 03:28:44
4OX8gdjJ22axNlKyXAuhTQ,vnqehTQ2kPv-oWb-9hcNfQ,NvaHGU03m-hvXIGScPe6WQ,2,1,0,1,"Just stayed here overnight on a Saturday as part of a bachelorette party. The hotel is in a super convenient location and the rooms were overall what I would expect from a Holiday Inn Express. 

Now I've stayed at a lot of Holiday Inns. Obviously they are not going to be the highest caliber hotel that you can find. But I must say that the staff at this particular HI was quite possibly the least helpful hotel staff I have ever encountered anywhere. 

First off, it took a solid 25 minutes for the woman working the front desk when we arrived to check us in. She kept noting computer problems (which I can understand) but 25 minutes, really? When we finally were checked in, we were informed that one of the two rooms we had booked was still not ready. Even though check out time is noon and check in is at 3 and we didn't arrive until 3:20 and by the time we checked in, it was close to four. In my humble opinion, there is absolutely no excuse for a room to not be ready an hour after check in. 
The woman working the front desk did apologize (very briefly and only once) for the delay but still, this a hotel, it should've been ready. 

As we were leaving the next day, we were checking out and I asked the woman (different woman from the day before) handling our check out if she could split the room into two different cards. I had a reloadable Visa gift card that I wanted to use on part of the room. The woman rolled her eyes and then took one look at the card and said that she knew the card wouldn't work. I asked her to please at least run the card to try it. She said since it was a gift card, it wouldn't work. (For the record, the beauty of these gift cards is that you can use them anywhere, as if they are a Visa debit/credit card). She grabbed the card from my hand, ran it through and hastily informed me that it didn't go through. She wouldn't even run the card a second time when I asked, she just very rudely shoved the card back and me and snapped that it ""wouldn't work."" I was very taken aback by the whole scenario because I have used the gift card in multiple circumstances and was very displeased that she seemed more interested in proving that she was right over cooperating with me (a paying customer). (Side note, I used the gift card on the automated parking machine outside the hotel not five minutes later and it worked flawlessly.) 

So overall, I would stay here again, it's Holiday Inn, it is what it is. But if you are looking for a friendly and helpful staff, this might not be the best place to stay.",2015-11-30 04:16:05

Prior to the dates, the reservations were made over the phone by a hotel representative and told the woman that i had a ""Be my guest gift certificate"".  She asked for the gift certificate number and it was for a standard room.  Hotel had been booked and received confirmation.  My girlfriend and i check in on our dates and i am told that my card has to be charged the full amount until their accounting clears the gift certificate.   We were placed in a king suite which i did not ask for and was under the impression that this was a standard.  So my card was charged for the room + incidentals which totaled $683.  Incidentals for a hotel is the normal but charging my card for the room amount was unexpected and should have been disclosed over the phone.  So they charged the wrong card which put my account into the negative.   Clearly my gift certificate said for one standard room so whom ever assumed i wanted a king suite should have clarified this prior.  Long story short.  It was arranged to where the next morning i would speak with the manager (Lauren) because they said i would have to pay the difference for the king suite.  And the arguement here was i should not be paying anything because i never asked for a king suite.  I even tried to have them switch me to a standard but they said they were all booked. Again i was suppose to speak to the manager directly but instead she sent out one of her staff to say they corrected the mistake.  There is way more to the story but i am leaving a 1 star because the manager did not even have the decency to come out and apologize for the inconvenience or introduce herself to the situation which was unprofessional and i felt like she avoided coming out to apologize at the fact that i am a young guy and black at that but if it had of been a white man.

We had to call friends & change our dinner reservations at Hacienda del Sol due to the delay. It was necessary to talk to multiple staff members & a manager to try to expedite the cleaning of our room by housekeeping. We were told no clean rooms were available at 4:30. Check in is at 4 pm. Once in the room we discovered that there was only one luggage rack & one robe. I requested another luggage rack & robe. Valet promised to send up another rack. When we returned at 10 pm there was still no additional rack or robe. Check in staff were rube, indifferent & unapologetic about not having clean rooms. Valet staff were unfamiliar with concept of retrieving our car & asked us where it had been parked. I requested a quiet room on the ground floor near elevator or close to lobby. We got a fifth floor room quite a ways from the elevator next to a room with noisy children. Rooms are outdated & this resort has seen much better days. It needs to train its staff to follow through & deliver on its reputation for excellence & comfort. This place is way too expensive for the unresponsive staff & below average accommodations.

My mother and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for 2  nights because my father had surgery at Jefferson Hospital.  The hotel is about 4 blocks from Jefferson's Gibbons Building making it convenient to get to and from the hospital.  However, when I called to inquire about the hotel accommodations  the morning of January 23rd I was given one rate using my AAA card and was told there were plenty of rooms available.  I called back about 3 hours later to make the reservation and the hotel rate had significantly increased (from 105 to upwards of over $150 without the AAA rate) and the next night the rate was back down again to the initial rate I was quoted at $105 with my AAA card.

I echo M.G.'s earlier comment that the staff overall was unprofessional.  Both times I called to make reservations the phone rang a number of times and then I was put on hold for at least 10 minutes.  I was asked to sign up for a Priority Member card, which I did but I never received an email confirmation.

When we arrived we was greeted by Justine! Started off so so but with each question we asked it turned into a  poor attitude and zero eye contact. The 1st question was about how to add this stay to my honors awards, answer she cant help me with that since my husband reserved online through a 3rd party. Ok fine, next question was being it our Anniversary what could the hotel accommodate us with to help make our stay as little more special. Justine flat out said nothing...that my husband should have booked online through the main site to find this put. Once her mouth kept moving rudely I wanted to turn around and request a refund.  Considering the reason we was there, we decided to stay. Walked to our room which the journey was through and old out dated hallway. Reached our room put the keycard in and it did not work. My husband had to walk all the way back to the front which wasnt close to inform Justine again of this problem. She said the key is fine it mist be the battery in the door, but the keycard all of sudden worked. Maintenance came and said nothing was wrong with the battery but the keycard must have not been activated SMH. We tried to make the best out of our weekend and decided to hit the jacuzzi which we hit the pool area which was loaded with screaming kids which wasnt a bother to us because we have 6 kids and we adore children.  The problem was we decided to head to the adult side in the casitas and slide into this jacuzzi. We was driving by a very nice young lady that drop is off left is and said when you ready just call us.  Well sadly to say by the time she came back with another couple and their lil son we was waiting outside to go back to the main hotel. Why? Because there was a couple in the jacuzzi having sex and did not stop once they saw us nor the other family. The nice young lady wish I got her name but she immediately apologized phoned security asked for her manager and apologized again. What a beginning of the start of a horrible Anniversary. Making the best of it we just joined a few kids splashing water and screaming at the sexless jacuzzi which was ok by now. The next day was check our time. I spoke with a Micheal whom I complained to about what our stay consisted of, Justine's rude behavior inconsiderate skills as the Manager of this Resort. She not once apologized for our incident at the jacuzzi, didnt offer us any additional comps or couldn't hand us a free mint. She had to many no's and alot of unapplied attempts to satisfy us an  customers.  I wouldn't choose this resort again if Justine is standing at the front desk. Oh and breakfast was horrible.

The negatives:  There was no consistent hot water, which meant that we were taking cool-to-lukewarm showers.  The barn door-style bathroom door didn't shut all the way, so there wasn't much privacy.  Everything about the breakfast was off-putting and the food quality was poor - several steps below a high school cafeteria.  The coffee was extremely bitter, and had an odd smell.  Loud music from adjoining rooms kept us up past midnight - you could hear everything through the thin walls.

V91QKDDwKvXMmdkaoCXYVg,JHQtZK-1GxJisoeZm3Pz5A,Dk0Yw7R8gCnkW78-n_Gv0A,1,3,1,0,"On Saturday, 2 June, a friend and I drove from Virginia to visit friends of mine from Texas in Philly. The check-in here was pleasant and the front desk staff were very accommodating although we checked in at around 11pm. My issue was with check out. I requested a late check out and was informed that late check out was 11am. Okay, no problem. 

The following day, I rushed to meet my friends for breakfast in the city at 9:30am, leaving my friend in the room. I figured I could leave at 9 and have at least an hour for breakfast and be back in time for check out. Unfortunately things did not go as planned. My friends hot water was out in their air bnb, so they were not ready on time as they waited for the owner to come and fix it. We ended up not getting to breakfast until around 10:15, and I ended up ordering and taking my food to go. At around 10:45, my friend who stayed behind called me to tell me that the front desk was calling her to leave the room. When I called the front desk, I advised them that I would be there in no more than an hour. I was then told that the manager was at the room letting my friend know that she had to leave. I am already rushing back, having to make a 20-min walk back to my car because neither my uber or Lyft accounts would allow me to order a ride for some reason. Get to the garage of the air bnb and my friends gave me the wrong code and getting a hold of them took another few mins. Drive back to the hotel in a bit of traffic, arriving to the hotel shortly after noon to see my friend in the lobby with all of my things packed which she ended up throwing into my suitcase due to the rush. 

As we were about to leave, she told me that the manager came to the door and told her she needed to wait for me in the lobby to which my friend replied she needed a few minutes. She told me that the manager told her that she had 2 mins and held the door open the entire time while she packed our things. I have never been treated so badly at a hotel and experienced such rude customer service. When I called to advise the front desk that I would arrive in less than an hour and offered to pay for another day I was told that the hotel was completely booked and that they could not allow me to extend. That was not true, I was able to go online to see that there were rooms available that I could have booked, however, I was not willing to stay at this establishment for one more night. 

My friend works for Marriott and he advised me to find out if the this establishment was marriott or franchise owned. I learned that this establishment is a franchise, and my friend replied that makes sense because a marriott-owned hotel would not have treated their guests this way. He also told me that there are no managers on the weekends and to go bavk inside to speak with the operations manager, as I was told that is who kicked my friend out of the room. When I went back inside, the ""operations manager"" was in the back office on a business call. I waited for 20 mins and she never came out to speak with me, I never met her, I do not even have her name. I grabbed all of the cards for the key personnel and intend on writing corporate in reference to this situation. 

I was not asking for a freebie, or an extension of more time without paying. My friend and I were treated as if we were problem guests and that was not the case. We arrived from out of town late, and my friend told me that she was sleeping when the knock came on the door for her to leave. A little common courtesy and professionalism would have been nice, seeing that a string of unplanned events caused my late return to this establishment. I did not understand the circumstances surrounding the extreme manner the staff went through to remove my friend and I from this room, as if we were there for a much longer period of time and it was getting extremely close to check in. I have stayed in many Marriott hotels and have never been treated this way. I do not want to use the race card here, but I can't help but wonder if that had something to do with it. I caution anyone that intends on staying here to maybe look elsewhere (I should have taken the other 1-star reviews into consideration). Being kicked out, having a manager hold the door open while you pack you and your friend's belongings, is just not a pleasant way to end a trip.

DR1rbts4eJkOqQfxMoSv-g,FLva7_LRaH2j5O896uJwhA,CFlW9bfl4N63fZpQsZIkRQ,1,2,1,1,I worked here 11 years ago when it was the illustrious Four Seasons.  My heart fell when I entered the front door.  The beautiful lobby is now a cold empty bar.  The once bustling lounge is now many dark and unwelcoming doors.  What was once the most sought after reservation in the city is now a trendy chic farm to table with servers wearing plaid shirts with suspenders.  I felt like I was in the twisted future of Marty McFly.  It is not what it was or what it should be but here we are.,2016-01-02 05:09:18

This was one of two options offered by the airline. The staff is remarkably rude. Right off the bat, when I called to request the shuttle, the front desk clerk refused to send the shuttle when I told him I was in baggage claim. He told me to call back once I was at the shuttle stop, which turned out to be out the door and a short walk--maybe a mere 20 yards away from where I was when I called him the first time. Seriously? Then when I arrived at the front desk, a different clerk was rude and officious about completing the blanks on the coupon, even though my reservation stated the email I received would suffice. Meanwhile I overheard the other clerk speaking rudely on the phone to other inbound customers who were calling in to request the shuttle. In general, the employees exhibit a clear disregard for--and even disdain for--their customers. Then on top of all that, the room was in pretty sad shape. Bare spots on the carpet, beat up furniture, etc. If you get stuck at the Philly airport, stay somewhere else.",2019-01-14 05:38:44
FmeZtXBEs3Ub1VObD_kzxg,A_OydtJ88zGIMs9euwDSVQ,Jw-ENQw-OGGwpM3nA3ywqw,1,0,0,0,"While initially this hotel should receive at most 3 stars due to the staff's helpfulness in the planning of our family reunion at this location, it's the housekeeping and management's lack of concern towards it that has dropped my review to a one star.

The positives about the hotel are the breakfast staff, who were excellent and extremely friendly while providing great service. As well as the young lady (Alicia, I believe her name was) who was the person who checked us in. Her attitude was phenomenal and that lady deserves a promotion. 

The neutrals - There is an Uno's and a 7-11 located right next door for food/drinks and late night conveniences. The hotel is located across from a college campus so, if you're looking for a bit more, take a short drive over to Philly.

Now for the bad and downright dirty - On our second day, we requested that the room be cleaned after we left out. Upon arrival back to the room, we saw that there was only one bed made in our 2 Queen Bed room, and a note left on the other bed stating ""UNFORTUNATELY YOUR ROOM COULD NOT BE COMPLETELY SERVICED DUE TO THE NUMBER OF ITEMS AROUND THE ROOM. WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE. IF YOU NEED ANY ADDITIONAL ITEMS PLEASE INQUIRE AT THE FRONT DESK - MANAGEMENT"". 
 
I have never in my entire life stayed at a hotel that would intentionally clean the room partially. This is pure laziness. I purposely always tidy upon my belonging before leaving any room because I don't like housekeeping moving my things but there was literally a NECK PILLOW AND MY PERSONAL BLANKET on the bed, they surely could've just moved them to the next bed and made it up. Where should I have placed those items? If the staff is picking and choosing what to clean when they feel like it, I can only imagine the behind the scenes filth.

When brought to the attention of the manager on duty at the time, Cheryl, I was informed that that was how they operated, even after showing her a picture of only my neck pillow and blanket on the bed. No apology was given at all. Management clearly allows this nonsense. There were also brown stains on a few towels, our ice bucket plastic bag was never replaced, towels were never picked up off the ground in the bathroom. 

During checkout, as we were leaving at our 12pm late checkout time, the lazy housekeeper, decided to rudely bang on the door and told us to hurry up and leave. If only she had been that excited to clean the night before. 

This place is lucky to still be in business, they should thank the heavens for the college next door.",2018-07-16 15:54:57

The staff here should be trained by the Marriott hospitality staff because they have a LOT to learn about customer service.

Upon checking, the front desk person was rude and condescending. I asked to upgrade my room and what the cost difference would be, she quoted me a price 100.00 more than what the price of the same room was online. She said she could not 'honor' the online price. LOL - so much for 'Hilton Honors' ha! I stay at Marriotts usually, and this never been told to me. 

The rooms in the main hotel are just ok. I guess they were renovated a few years ago, bu they are still drab. Also- the road behind buildings 1 and 2 where you are to park your car, is very busy! All day and night long cars pass through, non- hotel members, as there is a neighborhood behind the buildings....sounds like you are staying in NYC, that is how noisy it is.  Funny thing is, this rooms cost more because of the 'mountain view.' It's more of a view of the parking lot with sounds of a freeway.

The lounge in the main building is very small and lacks character. Not an inviting space to relax and enjoy the view. 

Overall, I would never stay here again. There are so many other beautiful hotels within a 20 mile radius, all with the same majestic views of the mountains, that are well trained in customer service and have beautiful updated rooms and amenities.",2019-04-25 15:48:01

I waited hours just for towels and such. Breakfast was a joke, they barely had anything that was advertised. The icing on the cake was when I ordered the breakfast burrito with no meat and it came with scraps of meat- as if someone forgot to not put it and then dug thru it to remove it. I sent it back and the manager I guess came back and assured me my taste buds where wrong and there was no meat- as a piece of bacon sat on the side of the plate where I pulled it out and put it. I again sent it back and this time the cook himself came out and proceeded to open the burrito and use his fingers to go thru it!!! All while my twin 12 year olds- whose birthday trip it is- and my 4 year old sat and watched in disbelief! I've never felt so embarrassed and disrespected before.

The elevator reeks of RAID, our first room had more of a lavender diaper scent, and our second room, whose carpets had just been cleaned, gave off more of a distinct nursing home meets bad yankee candle must. Our first room had one king sized bed and one pullout couch whose frame had clearly met an oversized visitor that pushed and exceeded the limits of what a pullout couch can handle. We had five guests. My siblings and I, young adults, decided to squish three on the king while our parents attempted to take the pullout. After discovering perhaps the saddest pullout couch in the history of pullout couches, we requested a room change. We were sent down the hall to a room with two double beds and a pullout couch that hadn't yet met an oversized guest or two. This room was immediately an upgrade and I surprisingly didn't miss the abundant water spots on the ceiling that headlined our views in the first room. We encountered an unruly group of lacrosse players who called out a couple slurs and TP'd the front of a room whilst moving, but this was more of a fun encounter as it provided a little comedic relief. Horrifically this was the highlight of our stay. As I dashed back to the first room to do a last minute scan for our items, I noticed several indescribable ""spots"" in our bathtub. I did enjoy the fan in the bedrooms but as someone with a nose, I didn't enjoy much of this stay.

Hotel pool is nice, the hotel has a nice charm. That being said.. a little old and run down. The carpet is peeling away from where the tile meets the carpet and the bathroom is so small.

First impression: the hotel decor is on point and well put together. Comfy and stylish seating looked welcoming. Different art pieces (sculptures and paintings) graced the lobby. Check in was smooth and the front desk was helpful. As our first day came to an end, I was pretty happy about my selection. Until it was time to sleep. I woke up at midnight itching. My husband asked me if I was okay and then he noticed his cheek was swollen from a bite. Yup, there were bed bugs. We called the front desk and they immediately sent someone (I think he was from the engineering department?) He was very polite and reassuring. He got to our room and we checked our beds and sure enough, he found two bed bugs. He captured a couple and placed it in a cup for a sample. We went downstairs and spoke to Matt and Paulette in the front desk. We had asked for allergy meds since my husband's face swollen and I have bad allergies to bugs. Matt was kind enough to get Benadryl for us. The front desk staff wasn't rude or mean, but as I spoke to them, they seemed indifferent. You would think that they would go the extra mile to comfort guests who were just bitten in so many areas (face, elbows, feet) they moved us from room 802 to 508. So tip: do NOT stay in 802. Our bellhop (wish I remembered his name) was very nice and chatted with our 7 year old son. He told us to call him if we ever need anything. My husband had a hard time falling back asleep at 1am, paranoid that there would be bed bugs again. As mentioned, the front desk seemed indifferent as if it was OUR fault. As if we wanted to find and get bitten by bedbugs. They didn't offer us a refund or to do our laundry (we were scared that we might take the bed bugs home with us) until we asked. We asked and we received the refund and the laundry was taken care for us. I spoke with Michelle on the phone the next day to ask about sending our laundry and she was kind enough to offer us vouchers to the on site restaurant Urban Farmer after I had asked if they served breakfast. Anyway, the lesson here is, if you need something done at The Logan, you need to ASK because they won't make that initiative to go above and beyond to rectify a bad experience. It would've been nice if they took care of everything without us going after them.

Here are the issues: we stayed in a suite for the weekend for $700+/night. Impeccable cleanliness is expected at this price point. There were black hairs on the bathroom floor and in the shower. The bidet (which I did not use btw) didn't look impeccably clean. The lighting in the room was dim, especially in the vanity area, and one of the lamps did not work. Housekeeping never came on Saturday.. so ended up making our own bed in the afternoon.
We also had an adjoining room for the weekend which we paid an additional $350+/night. There was furniture blocking the doors to the adjoining rooms, so we had to move chairs and lamps in order to gain access. We spent over $1000/night to move furniture!? This should have been set up prior to check-in. These details are key.

We stayed as part of a room block for our daughter's wedding. There were issues with this too. One was the hotel contact person had an attitude, almost to the point of rudeness, about one last-minute reservation change. In addition to the block of rooms, we rented several pods at the rooftop Assembly lounge. In total our group dropped over $30K for the weekend. At this price point, I expect five star service.

My room seemed fine better than most I've been to and I had no problems.  Didn't realize the other two weren't maintained until a day after.

1 of my guests was disgusted since they had not cleaned his linens on arrival.  The front desk assured me they would take care of it and that they weren't allowed to rent out dirty rooms.  They simply made the bed.  I brought this up with the front desk again and the lady brought up linens and did not change the bed.  Soon after I got a call saying he was treated rudely by the front desk lady.

Soon after my other guest asks why there's a garbage bag outside his door.  I'm not certain this is related but I'm suspicious.  At this point his room was not cleaned either after two requests.  He left a couple bucks for the cleaning staff on the pillow since arrival.  Usually I figure it's an unnecessary gesture.  Even more so here.

On checkout I spoke with a manager who simply apologized.  I suggest the front desk better communicate with cleaning staff who needs to get their act together.

1) the customer service and hospitality 
2) the room itself 
3) hotel amenities 
4) the hotel restaurant
5) the surrounding area. 
6) United hotel and food voucher 
7) over all summary of my stay. And a note for people who are booking this hotel without the airline voucher. 
8) tv channels by their number (there is no guide in the hotel for the tv) 

1) the customer service and hospitality over all was decent. I got there at around 7:30 ish (by the courtesy shuttle that you can call to let them know where you're at) once I arrived it was empty and there was no one at the front desk but I guess they heard or saw me because someone came out pretty quickly. The lady that started to help me was pretty nice and courteous, there was a pilot behind me so she asked if she could help him first which I didn't mind. Another woman came out to help me with a little bit more of an attitude. Like she mentally checked out of work and wasn't having it but she wasn't rude to me specifically it was just her demeanor. She said the system always goes super slow so she was upset at that. But eventually I was checked in. When I checked out the lady was also super nice so I didn't have a problem like some with the people that work there. However I read reviews before I got there so I was sort of prepared for the worst. To my surprise I got decent help but I could imagine those people that had issues also gave some attitude (long flights and you just want to get in bed).  

2) the room itself was a good room. It had all the essentials you would need. I was in room 139. It didn't smell weird, it was very clean, and everything was ready for me (in other reviews people experienced something different). Overall I enjoyed the room. Ample lighting, tv with I'm assuming basic cable (you cannot connect it wirelessly with your phone or anything. There was an hdmi and DVD player connection tho). The sheets and towels were clean and I enjoyed my stay. The only hassle with the room that I had was the tv. There is no guide and there's 39 channels so I had to write down what each channel was and then look up a guide. If you're not into tv then it probably won't matter but I had nothing else to do so I took the time to write it out. I've added the channels and their numbers at the end of this review. Again overall the room was good. Complimentary soap, shampoo, body bar, and cotton swabs/ ear swabs. Lots of places to plug in and charge your devices. Mini fridge. Etc. etc. 

3) I didn't do too much in the hotel. They have a gym, and pool (outdoor) and that's about it for fun and entertainment outside the room. They have a ballroom and weeding reception room, as well as a conference room but I'm sure most of people reading this won't need that. 


4) the restaurant in the hotel is not half bad. I was expecting some bland tasteless food but it actually seems kind of fresh and very tasty. I got the cheesy burger with fries and a cheesecake for dessert. The burger was nicely cooked and had the right amount of cheese, tomato, onion, and lettuce to go with it. The fries were actually seasoned! I did not expect this. I expected what would taste like microwaved fries but the seasoning was just enough and they were fresh and crunchy but hot and soft inside. You can dine in, carry out, or have the food taken to your room (I'm sure the third option costs extra). I got mine for take out. It was not busy at all, only three other people were in there. I did think it took only slightly too long for the food to cook but I'm hoping that was because it's all freshly cooked to order. There was an older couple eating and even they had to compliment the waitress on the food. The menu is small but I think everyone could find something they like. 

5) The surrounding area has a nice variety of food and entertainment. In walking distance (0.5 miles or less) there is a Wawa, a Denny's right across the street, another restaurant just passed that. There is a sonoco for gas or snacks, a valero a little passed that, a few other small restaurants that look very good (they had that homemade grandma cooking in the back look), and a few bars/ pubs if you want to have a drink or a night out. So a nice variety of things to choose from if the restaurant in the hotel is too pricey for you (which it is a little pricey my cheeseburger, cheesecake, and can ginger ale cost 21$ altogether).",2019-05-03 16:59:18

I've had to endure walking my dog and seeing dirty drug syringes, a constant mildew mold smell in my room and throughout the hotel, a person overtop of me with 6 kids running, jumping and banging all time's of the day and night with paper thin walls and floors, a broken tv for almost 3 months that is still not fixed and I had to get my own tv and try to use a hotspot on my phone bc their internet ( even when u do the buy up) never works, marijuana and smoke smell as soon as u step outside the doors of the hotel, seeing drug exchanges and a incompetent manager that lies and will never resolve an issue, but try to make u the problem when brought to her attention. I was forced to call the cops several time's bc of the disturbances upstairs and the fear for my health and safety and the lack of management help ( I was basically told to pay my $525 a week and deal with the issues). The police literally told me I was not the type of person that stays at this property and should find somewhere else to stay. I asked the cop was I being a nuisance since that's what the manager stated as she threatened me with calling the cops wouldn't end well for me( I'm assuming bc I'm Black) and he stated that they are constantly at this hotel before I even checked in and this hotel is always a problem ( believe you will see the cops here constantly). I've reached out to corporate genome has never responded or even tried to assist with my issues. The manager even tried to lie and state I wasn't paying when I pay on time and early a lot of times ( I have my receipts and emails to manager expressing my concerns). So I'm assuming corporate supports the manager unprofessional behavior and is ok with the property being used as a drug place . I actually read responses from people online and this seems to be the culture of these hotels all over ( apparently people get government aide and vouchers to stay here). If ur not a drip addict avoid this place at all cost.

Not convinced the sheets were changed, found a long hair under the pillows.
The front desk woman was as rude and sharp tongued as could be. The shuttle driver was grouchy. 
Would never stay here again, not even for a free night.

 The nameless restaurant was the only decent thing there. The servers were friendly and kind and the food was good and fairly priced.  

*** If corporate is reading this, you really should make a point on training your front desk people better, perhaps some basic people skills. They set the tone at the time of checkin for your entire stay. Amazing what customers are willing to ignore when treated with kindness,patience and respect.

Was told upon check in that rooms were only being serviced every four days but they would put us on the 3rd day service. Keep in mind that each night we have to call to the front desk to ask for water, coffee... shampoo etc.. towels.. and also the robes that never were available upon arrival.. .. wait time is at least an hour which can be considerable when you've been out all day and get back to your room ready to shower and relax.. we are now on day 3 and trash is piling up.. no water, no coffee and no fresh towels because housekeeping never showed up.. We were told by the snarky front desk person that she would follow up and find out what happened so it doesn't happen again.. that's fine for the Hilton, but how does that help me? Now her tone starts to move more to the sassy side when she says since I don't like her solution then what do I suggest? Really? Who is in charge of customer service? How about move me to another room? How about a complimentary wine and appetizer at the bar while your staff fixes the problem? Maybe a $100 credit at the spa? Free round of Golf? How about comping the room? Clearly none of these ideas even entered her customer service sphere .... I've stayed in several hotels since COVID and this is by far the worst experience.  There's nothing worse than paying a premium price for a hotel stay..  having dirty towels on the floor.. trash bins full.. no shampoo ( because it's late and still a no show) and a rude front desk person who has no concept, concern or ability to rectify the situation...",2021-04-08 03:21:52

There were at least 4 wedding parties staying there and I heard a bunch of complaints.

We were told the bride had the ""Bridal Suite""; we went to check in and the room was a regular suite, frankly very small size for a bridal party to get ready in but fine.  More importantly, the curtains over the windows were caked in dust.  

I had huge issues checking in the day of the wedding, they refused to call me when a room was available and insisted I keep checking back even though I was in the hotel already and trying to get hair and makeup done before the wedding.  I stayed at two other hotels earlier in the week and neither had any problem letting me try to check in early.  

We ordered breakfast from room service, the eggs tasted like plastic and they didn't bring butter or jam or anything for the toast.  $60 breakfast for two people and it was awful.  

Along with another wedding, we headed to the bar for an after party.  The bartenders were AWFUL.  I get that it was busy but we've all been to busy bars before and there is no need to be plain rude.

The mattresses had blood stains my pillows had blood stains as well as my blanket and we asked for new stuff but only provided with the bare minimum.

Front desk exceptional. Kept having problem with room keys. They finally gave us a free drink in the bar...very kind.

Spa girls super friendly. Massage excellent.   Free bicycle every day....fun, but sore....next time bring padded bike shorts!  Free hour each day at country club driving range....SUPER fun to try, and pros available for about $85/hour for one hour lesson.

I had to wait to check in because only one of the three people at the front desk wasn't too busy with a personal conversation.  The room was sad.  Not threadbare, just a sad shade of gold that will probably not change as it gets worn and dirty.  More practical than attractive.  The bathroom was really small in that way makes you wonder how much smaller people were fifty years ago.  Painted surfaces seemed like they had about 10 layers of paint, wallpaper was only ripped and peeling in a few places.  And there was no safe.

The good news:  A coffee maker in the room, free wi-fi, and no bedbugs.  The hotel was a few blocks from the convention center, which is a plus.  The neighborhood seemed safe and my room on the 9th floor facing Walnut St. was relatively quiet.  The walls are thin but I had quiet neighbors.  Even though I heard phone conversations, I didn't get woken up.  There are two convenience stores across the street (Citi is the good one) so you can easily stock up on whatever you need.  I was always bumping into staff in the elevator and except for one bellman, they were always friendly.

There was a free breakfast but I didn't try it.  Staff highs and lows: Gwen (I think) at the front desk at 10 AM on 5/19 took care of things quickly and efficiently.  She was the best.  The bellman who walked into the elevator in front of me on 5/19 at about 2 PM while I was trying to get out with my luggage (and then gave me a dirty look) was about the rudest guy I encountered.

The average on Yelp is 3.5 stars but the rating details show that the recent average is more like 2.5.  I think that was about right and I'm rounding it up to 3 because 2 stars seems a little harsh.

~ Hot and fresh waffles in the morning.  Every La Quinta provides buttermilk batter for guests to make their own waffles during breakfast.  The smell of fresh waffles can quickly wake me up.

~ BBQ Rib Cook-off convenience.  Every Labor Day weekend, there is an air-conditioned shuttle service available for Rib Cook-off guests.

Areas I would improve on are:
Upon check in (Diamond member) not given the snack that are on display at the front desk, not told about any of the hotel amenities like making a reservation for using the gym, laundry room, or 3-8pm fresh hot cookies served (saw that on my last day), noticeable hallway carpet stains. First room was nothing like I asked for, bathroom issues and request for extra pillows ignored/forgotten. Second room: no trash can, no alarm clock and no iron. Wifi kept kicking off cell when idle, so left on constant streaming to prevent this. Exits have no trash cans, so smokers leave a mountain of cig butts that are not picked up.  Room had stray marks on the wall and a spider in the bathroom, plus spartan bathroom (no decor) baseboards need repainting (brown stains). Maids let doors constantly slam until well past 7pm. Could they not use a door jam when cleaning to prevent this nuisance? Also, vacuums and dirty mop buckets left out during the day and on one occasion vacuuming hallway at 9:30pm.",2021-05-23 13:00:34

t009tI2gqPSAvu1LbIJ4zg,dkvRoZ646VM9fwqARUcHgg,9PXJkRLVWd6IMPfBzdJp2Q,4,4,1,3,"Actual rating is 3.5, so I'm rounding up here. 

To start, I cannot stress how beautiful this place is. From the well-maintained grounds, to the large, open lobby with tasteful southwestern decor, to the pool area, to the stunning views of the Catalinas, this place earns a 5/5 for aesthetics alone. It's worth a visit just to see this place. 

In addition, the restaurant Epazote is a real gem. I have dined there many times and am always happy with the food, the service, and the unbeatable view.  While I didn't dine here during this stay, it looked like the restaurant t was doing a steady business, which I was really glad to see. 

My brother and my sister-in-law held a party in the Sundance room to celebrate their recent marriage and the hotel did an excellent job executing this. The party was well
organized with friendly, professional staff,delicious appetizers, and good bar service.

With this being said, there is room for improvement. Check-in was an unnecessarily  complex process. Not only do they give you about 15 pieces of paper, the process was also tinged with sexism. My mom made the room reservations for her and my dad and for my husband and me, and despite making the reservations herself and putting them on her credit card, it was my dad--the man--who had to come to the front desk and show his ID in order for my mom to check into her room. Same thing for my husband and our room. It made absolutely no sense. 

In addition, some of the events that were advertised as happening never occurred. The schedule said there would be trivia at 5 in the lobby bar. Gus, who checked us in, said we should definitely check it out, but upon arriving to the bar, there was no trivia to be found. 

Finally, while our room was very nice with absolutely stunning views of the mountains, the bed was horrible. I'm probably being extra harsh here because I'm 9 months pregnant, but I've never slept on a softer mattress. I found it nearly impossible to roll over. That on top of the super heavy comforter and the lack of a fitted sheet on the bottom made me have a pretty miserable night of sleep. However if you like insanely soft beds that feel like you're sinking into a vat of butter, then this is your place!  

I didn't get to enjoy the pool, but my husband loved it, so if I come back, I would love to enjoy that amenity. 

Overall, this place is beautiful and with some minor tweaks, it would easily be 5 stars in my book.",2021-06-28 22:43:38
RRqyzKLVmuaplezMnJ30rA,wmEk-exSH0g6ouWEGYgu8A,9PXJkRLVWd6IMPfBzdJp2Q,1,3,0,0,"NEVER, EVER, EVER again will I book a room at the El Con! It is a ""con"" job...that's for sure!! My girlfriend and I, both disabled, had the most stressful spa getaway weekend of our lives! I am fighting numerous health issues including seven autoimmune disorders and extremely brittle diabetes as a necrotizing pancreatitis survivor. It is difficult for me to travel because of my many health issues and constant concern with how I will receive meals. I was delighted to be able to make these plans after 2 years involving lengthy hospital stays (to celebrate just being alive) but was in tears by the end of my weekend....

NOTE: DO NOT MISS THE SPA. Lydia is phenomenal. But save yourself the headache, book through Groupon, and stay at a Motel 6 if you want better hotel mgmt and service. The grounds are gorgeous but this is Tucson... that's par for the course for these resorts! I can look at mountains and beautiful grounds at home.

1). I booked TWO Spa packages for 2 nights which included charcuterie boards and souvenir size champagne (though neither of us drink). They gave us one board and 1 bottle of champagne. We had to ask for crackers because they forgot (even though a cheeseball was included). When I inquired about the 2nd board on Saturday, they had a hostess call to tell us they would not be sending it and made a reference to the idea we were trying to overindulge in the alcohol. No, we were more interested in the charcuterie board before our spa appt because we were starving.

2. This is not an ADA or handicapped friendly environment. There is A LOT of walking to get to rooms, the lobby, spa, etc. I was told my requests to be placed near an elevator and other accommodations would only be honored if we booked an accessible room. When I contacted Hilton Cus Svr, the front desk lied to Hilton and said they couldn't switch rooms because they were totally booked. There was ONE wedding booked on Saturday and it was completely dead on Sunday.

3) There is ONE restaurant open on the premises and it only serves rooms on Friday and Saturday between 5-9PM. Everything else had to be picked up and we would have had to drive all around 3 buildings to get to the restaurant near the lobby (I have mobility issues due to chronic lung conditions that cause extreme fatigue.) They didn't care.

4) A breakfast was to be included but no one cared to inform us of where it would be held. When I contacted the Front Desk (Augustine), I was told I could find a copy of the breakfast menu on the website.. No... only broken links there. He argued with me and finally someone came up and threw a menu on the floor. Hilton Cus Svc asked if I asked about this. No, I did not because in all of my years of traveling (US and Int'l), especially for spa getaways and secret shoppings, I have NEVER had to ask for amenities that were supposed to be included in the overall package. My bad.

5) The dinner meal offerings were meager and of a bar/grill nature...many of which I cannot consume. We tried Door Dashing it...

6) Door Dasher was not allowed to deliver food to the room...so I had to retrieve my Sat breakfast delivery from the lobby. Even though I drove, it was stone cold.... cold eggs.... great.

7) I was advised by the front desk and Hilton CS to make my own delivery arrangements closer to the room. Ok... I did....I told him I would meet him outside our gate.

8) The Door Dasher was stopped driving in the parking lot and told to leave it at the front desk. No one informed me. By the time I got to the lobby, $90 meal...stone cold. 

9) Do you know what it is like to have low blood sugar? On vacation? Because you cannot get a secure meal plan????

10) The rooms were musty; some areas could benefit from more attention. There was hair on the bathroom floor. No vent in the bathroom. The toilet seat broke from regular use (cheap, cheap plastic...my hubby is a plumbing professional... I know cheap when I see it.) Cheap, cheap bathroom amenities (you'd think they would have provided spa product samples. Who does the marketing?)

11) I called Hilton Cus Svc 4 times during my stay. I was given a case number on my last contact and told I would hear from someone in 3 days (even the email said so). Day 4, I called and was told I had to wait 3-5 days. I called on day 7 and was finally offered some options to make up for the poor service... but I refuse to take chances on a $1000 hotel booking ever again. Hilton is usually an exceptionally well run organization but this place is dragging their name through the mud!!

12) The wifi is HORRIBLE!! Not for business purposes!!

13) Don't take my word for it, read MANY of the other reviews which, I see, mgmt didn't care to respond to.  I sure should have.

Bottom line... I understand pandemic difficulties but nasty and disrespectful attitudes by staff have nothing to do with that. If you charge pre-pandemic prices and resort fees, you should provide pre-pandemic service.",2021-09-28 01:32:32

Well I've been Hilton Honor member probably 10 years now and I'd have to say that this has been by far my worst stay not only with the issues in the room , but also customer service agent Miranda , which I believe is her name I tried clarifying but she was abrupt and rudely hung up the phone. So let's start with the room , checked in a little before 8 pm last night opened the small mini fridge and it smelt like death, days old garbage smh... called front desk , the young lady came up and cleaned it right away , also advised her that the Kleenex box was empty and that the toilet didn't flush (room 219) however my husband fixed the toilet issue, when I called front desk to tell them about no Kleenex and the toilet not flushing however my husband fixed it , she proceeds to tell me to adjust valve in the back. Like really , smh, we had to fix issue or self , so this was strike 1, 2 and 3. My husband and I go enjoy The Row fireworks, came back to room around 1 am , you know happy New Years , went to sleep and during the middle of the night the air conditioner starts making weird noises and room gets really hot, so I did not get a comfortable nights sleep, called front desk at 6 am , and told Miranda to cancel my next nights stay because I was unhappy with all the issues with the room and also told her that I was so unhappy with my stay that I wanted my money back. At first she was gracious, empathetic and said that she would cancel and refund tomorrow night and refund my money. Ok fine conversation should had been over , however then she goes on to say ""why didn't I call her , that she was here all night "" so I told her that I am calling it's 6 am I should be sleep but I can't. She then goes on to blame me for not reaching out sooner , or you kidding me, ""I'm the guest "" they knew that this was a shitty room before they gave it to me and further more as I type this review people are stomping on the floor above. I guess that's my fault too. I was just going let it go because I know that the front desk can't control everything, but Miranda only made bad situation worst by insulting me saying it's my fault which is horrible customer service, well they wil never have to worry about me again as I will never stay at this location again. I feel that I'm owed an apology and I will be reaching out to upper management to get that apology that I'm owed. And also they need blackout curtains I can't sleep because of the light as well.

Booking.com pleaded with them to change our reservation to a closer location due to the travel time. They simply said no. They gave us no choice but to drive over 6 hrs to arrive there. We arrived there around 3am just to find out that they automatically canceled our room and failed to inform us of this. We asked the ""night manager"" GEOFFRY why they canceled and still charged us. He said we would have to pay AGAIN for one night and would NOT issue a refund. We were in disbelief at how we were treated by Geoffry.

There was issues for a paid for room, the hotel said the website is not a guarantee through 3rd party sites. We mentioned the hotel being a 5 star and they were happy to say NO we are a 4 star.

Mask wearing in the lobby is mandatory but not enforced so expect about a 75% compliance rate.

Trying to communicate with the manager, Jayson Miller, waste of time. I emailed him as told by the staff. Days passed heard nothing so I called several times each person not very friendly and simply told me he is busy. I gave it one last shot and finally spoke to someone who really tried to help me. Her name was Brenida, probably mispelled. She located Jayson and asked him the questions and called me back immediately. However Jayson gave us horrible prices. When I looked online to book for that exact weekend. It was Much cheaper than what my guests were offered, and by hotel standards located on the website, blocking rooms with them we are gaurenteed best pricing and lower. I contacted Brenida and she looked herself and saw the prices he gave were high, she was very sweet and asked if I could call her the following day so she could present the information to Jayson. However I was over dealing with this and dealing with the back and forth. I contacted the holiday inn express right down the street and was immediately dealt with then and there given a great price and all questions answered. So just simply went with them because of how swift and simple they made it for me. 
I thought about contacting Hampton inn and trying for a better price but thought to myself, if Jayson the manager treated me with no respect and only 1 of the 5 employees I spoke with treated me well, I really Dont want my guests dealing with the unprofessional and unfriendly staff either.

From the moment we walked in we were smacked in the face with overwhelming smoke. Parking wasn't ideal and the place looked grimey. There were signs everywhere about the hotel not being responsible for theft, which is reasonable, but after checking in we took the hotel up to our floor and a fellow patron said to be wary of theft because their room had been robbed twice. Because of this we had to take all of our stuff to and from the car whenever we left. The room wasn't clean and didn't have coffee, toiletries, or towels so we had to go back downstairs to get all of that from the front desk. We stayed 2 nights and when housekeeping cleaned after the first night they didn't replace toiletries or towels or coffee. We also noticed there was no refrigerator and the front desk told us it's $10 extra per night. The tv was an ancient box tv that made a loud ringing noise when on. The view from our hotel room was terrible. Looked straight onto a roof and because of the location it made the wind going by unbearable. We weren't able to sleep well because of the wind noise. AND the next morning we found BED BUGS on our stuff and on the beds. Ran to front desk to tell them and they didn't believe us. The front desk and head of housekeeping were very rude and head of housekeeping said she needed to go and see for herself. After showing her pictures and the physical dead ones we smashed she still didn't believe. It wasn't until she lifted a sheet and found a HUGE one that she said ""okay, that's definitely a bed bug. She told me the manager wouldn't be in today so I should just leave and go about my business and they'll give me a cal. We checked out at 7am and went straight to Home Depot to buy trash bags for our stuff and spray for the car. Thanks to this I'll have to waste my lift ticket and go take care of this issue before it gets worse and I risk infesting my house. 

When I went upstairs with housekeeping my friend overheard the front desk ladies talking saying, ""I don't understand why people just decide to sleep with these little critters and then complain the next day."" You seriously think I'd sleep in your hotel after finding BED BUGS?? We didn't see one until we were packing up our stuff but they clearly didn't care and acted like it was our fault for not finding them earlier.

They give you an iPad that taps into guest services. Unfortunately that's all it really can do. There is maps, Internet and hotel services. No app store, no game center. 

There is a new computerized climate control system in the room. I found it really annoying. I had it set at 73 degrees and it was chilly, so I turned it to 74. The AC turned off and the heat turned on! Also, at night sometimes it would click on and off every 30 seconds. It wasn't great.

The TV was about 32"" which was undersized for the distance from the bed. They have a media center expander, which lets you plug in your iPod, HDMI, VGA, really anything you want. This is a great idea. I wish I could have changed the aspect ratio on the TV though. Netflix from my laptop was very stretched.

Also the TV turns on automatically when you enter the room. There is no way to disable this, although you can just turn it off with the remote.

The shower door (glass) leaked ALL over the floor. It was unacceptable. I had to put down several towels to sop it up.

This is hands down the worst experience I've ever had at any hotel, or any business for that matter, and my standards are lower than most peoples! We booked our rooms over the phone and were quoted a price including taxes and fees and free breakfast.  
        Upon checking in we were told we would not receive free breakfast and the front desk manager basically called us liars for saying someone on the phone had told us that.  We were brushed off and told to return in the morning to speak to an employee who, we learned in the morning, would not be in till noon. Obviously breakfast was over by then.  When we came back we again spoke to the incredibly rude front desk manager Robert who lied and said he'd listened to the phone call and that we were wrong. When we confronted him further, he said that he had no way to listen to the phone call. When we asked to see his manager, he supposedly went and spoke to her and came back saying ""in order to avoid a war of worlds, she said just to give you the breakfast"".  Of course we had already missed that mornings breakfast, so it was still not what we'd been promised.  The general manager, if she really exists, refused to speak to us, leaving us at the mercy of the evil Robert. Upon checking out, we also were charged a different price than we'd been quoted. Two weeks later, we are still dealing with Ramada corporation trying to get a refund.

The Toilet fit their obvious theme of ""poorly cleaned or recently used"" as did the entire room for that matter.

I came to Philadelphia for the first time to attend my son's graduation from Penn. I am not a rich person by any means and I booked my room one year in advance and feel that the Hilton Franchise must assume that anyone who stays in their hotels over graduation weekend can afford the $609.00 a night room not including tax with a four night minimum. Did I agree to this? Yes! but I don't agree with the fact that they jack the prices up so high. As a matter of fact my son was on a full academic scholarship because this would have never been a University I could have sent him to otherwise. I did appreciate the fact that his housing was located right next to the hotel as was the Penn Bookstore. The customer service was very hit and miss and the room was not even as nice as some places I have stayed in Reno Nevada, which is close to my home. The refrigerator was unplugged when I got to my room and the freezer had thawed into the tray underneath and I had to try and empty it in the bathroom sink and I never got the microwave I requested a week before. The room never seemed to be dusted the entire time I was there either. The two women working the desk the morning I checked out were down right rude because I asked for a room service charge to be removed for food I never received but my biggest concern with this hotel is that they put not one but two different holds on my credit card for two different amounts of money without my knowledge! They never told me they were doing it and did not have me sign anything. Most hotels take an imprint of your card for any charges to the room for which are not paid but they don't run those charges until you check out. I did not learn of the holds on my account until I got home the next day and Shirley was less than helpful when I called. Again, I am not a rich person! In fact the card I was using only had a $1000 credit limit on it and I was $11.00 from being overdrawn. This practice is not acceptable!

Meanwhile we were on google making sure we were right about it being a bed bud, indeed we were.. Crazy..

So the guy Steve who came up was so quick to switch us to a room across the hall room 416. As I finished packing my things my friend tried to go ask if we could take a picture and he admitted that it was full grown and kept walking away, said we couldn't take a picture. He also claims that the new room (416) has brand new mattresses. So as any one would do after they have discovered bed bugs I naturally started to check the mattresses and sheets. We discovered that not only were they not new, they had major piss stains. And when I say that someone must've pissed and they just flipped them because the piss had also got onto the bed skirt and dried with the mattress. Which means there was never any attempt to clean the piss. (Check out the pics attached) ..Just horrible. I don't recommend this hotel to anyone..

The rest of the hotel is under construction -although according to the other reviews, it's been under construction for months. This meant I could hear banging at times. 
It also meant that one elevator was out of order. The remaining elevator was disgusting and broken looking. The lights didn't work to indicate what floor you were on. The doors and walls were similar to that of a truck stop bathroom- gross. The buttons were broken and I honestly worried everytime I got in that I would be stuck there. 
The ice machines were all out of order.
The ground floor had the most construction going on- the floor was covered with what appeared to be old carpeting (to keep the new floor clean??) but it was a tripping hazard and made the place look like a dump. The remaining areas were dusty and just unpleasant to look at. The lobby was clean, though.
The continental breakfast was nice. A big selection of waffles, bagels, oatmeal, cereal, eggs, sausage, and homefries.  There were a variety of teas and coffee out all day long, too.

Loved that the hotel is only four stories since that equates to FAST elevators.  The hotel is right next to the bookstore so we popped in at 9:20pm to buy a tshirt...that was convenient.   

The only problem I had with this hotel is the grumpy, grouchy, mean, snappy and crass breakfast staff (two ladies working the dining room and one guy behind the counter).

There's breakfast included -- it consists of steam-table eggs, breakfast meat du jour (bacon strips or ham circles), bagels, yogurt, mini-danishes, and a do-your-own-waffle thing.  Not bad.  Even better are the 2-hour receptions in the evenings, which feature unsupervised and unlimited tap beers (too bad selections consist of my two least-favorite beers, Coors Lite and Fat Tire), jug wine, and snacks.  

My morning CNN and Headline News is disrupted by signal dropouts every few minutes; this wasn't just my TV but also confirmed by my business associate also staying at the hotel.  Another lesser annoyance was that the maid one day completely neglected the bathroom.  

All told, a few blocks away from my business trip site, this Homewood Suites accomplishes everything it needs to do, and nothing more.",2015-10-16 01:53:14

When we arrived at the hotel around 10pm, there was no one at the front desk. There was a sign on the counter with instructions to call a number for service. Since my hands were full, I had my daughter call the number. She called and hung up immediately telling me that the person in the other line yelled at her as soon as she requested help. I then called the number myself and requested help. I could not make everything that was said but understood someone was coming. A short while later a man comes out of the elevator yelling about how he is the only one there and that he does not need any attitudes. I told him I didn't have any attitude and only wanted to check in. He continued to rant loudly and I told him not to yell at me raising my voice to be heard. He then refused me service, locked himself in the managers office and called the police. Who know what he told the police but they arrived in two cars. I told the officers what happened but they honored his request to not allow me to check in. I had them wait until I was assured that the room was not charged to my credit card and if it was that the money was refunded to me. I was not able to get any verification from the manager. I then had to deal with Hilton customer service in my car. As I sat with my daughter in my car in the parking lot trying to find another room, an officer approached my car again.

I am a former business traveler with Hilton Diamond status, and have stayed at my fair share of Hampton Inns. While the age and decor of properties can vary pretty widely, the customer service is typically, consistently top notch. 

While this Hampton appears like a nice place, the service is absolute crap. I stayed here in February 2016. We arrived, checked in, and the interactions with the front desk were fine, though certainly not up to typical Hampton standards. The room was clean on arrival, but after an hour or so, it was getting incredibly hot. I checked the thermostat and confirmed that it was set appropriately, but the heater continued to blow hot air. I turned the thermostat off, and it continued to blow hot air. I called the front desk and they said someone would be right up. So we waited. And waited. And waited. I walked down to the front desk, expecting there had been an evening rush and they were busy. Nope, empty lobby. The front desk staff (playing on his cell phone) admitted that he completely forgotten about us. I asked if we could simply switch rooms, but he insisted on coming to look at the thermostat. So he came up, fiddled with the thermostat, and explained that they break pretty frequently, and this one appears to be broken. I stated that we would need a new room, and he agreed to move us. 

All of that, while not great, would have still garnered a 3 star review. 

Flash forward to April, when my in-laws stayed at this property. They reported that the front desk staff was rude, and that despite their requests for service, the room was not cleaned during their stay. They wrote to the manager, who failed to respond, and eventually contacted Hilton corporate, who gave them a voucher for a free night. (Whatever happened to Hampton's money back guarantee??) 

They're back in town this weekend and booked two rooms, planning to use the voucher for one of them. The first pair of their party checked in and went to their room. In the meantime, my in-laws presented their voucher, and were very rudely told by the front desk that it couldn't be used since they had prepaid for the room. They asked to speak with the manager - the same manager that was there during their last stay - who maintained that they couldn't use the voucher, as the room had already been paid for. My father in law asked for their names (so he could reference them specifically when contacting Hilton corporate), and only then did they finally offer that they could void the transaction and take the voucher. 

Meanwhile, my brother and sister in law, already in their room, found only one towel, along with a used bar of soap and shampoo in their shower. Clearly, it had not been cleaned. 

The rooms were refunded, voucher thrown away, and they are now at the Holiday Inn.",2016-07-31 13:51:25

RIFX_PFbISVdQV_l7hgNxw,w-VZ6OWIAYhRgjCjRVwcwQ,41VRaFKM_6EaBX7eiM5dog,1,2,0,0,"There was only one bright spot in my 18-night stay at this horrible property, and it was Stacie. She is the only reason I continued to stay past the first day. 

To sum this up quickly, this property does not meet Wyndham standards and needs to be dropped from the Wyndham program. 

I realized that my stay at this particular property was not going to be pleasant at check in. That was when I was told that despite being a Diamond Level member that there were no upgrades available. More specifically, I was told ""not at that room rate"" by the desk supervisor. 

I am required to book my travel, per my company's policy, through a service called Concur, also known as Executive Travel.  Ironically, had I booked my room directly through Wyndham, my total for the three week stay would have been several hundred dollars less than I paid through Concur. Regardless, the rate paid is not a determining factor for upgrades according to the Wyndham program rules. But that's what I was specifically told by the supervisor that checked me in. When I asked again, I was told this time it was ""subject to availability and there are no rooms available"". 

The next day Stacie called out of the blue and let me know that she was upgrading me to a suite and that if she wasn't there to talk to the desk staff.

When I showed up that evening that same shift supervisor was on duty. The desk agent asked her about my upgrade and she was told, in front of me, that she needs to note that my upgrade was authorized by Stacie and to ""cover your (expletive) on this one"". Yes, she said that right in front of me. 

After a few interactions with the front desk over the next few days, I realized I just needed to stay away from the front desk. Every time I had interaction with the front desk, I was told that they needed to move me to a different floor and to a regular room. Regular rooms were in worse shape than the suites, so I avoided the front desk after that. I came to realize quickly that the supervisor was unhappy she was overridden in her decision to refuse an upgrade.

When I got to my room, it was dirty and in poor repair. The carpet was torn in places, the furniture was old and scratched. The TV's were 32"" tube type. The internet was unreliable and slow. The hot water in the shower barely worked due to a malfunctioning valve. I believe I was given the worst suite in the hotel as retaliation for my asking for an upgrade and countering all of the objections the supervisor gave as reasons to not give an upgrade.

But wait! There's more! 

There was a pimp running hookers from the front corner of the hotel near the entrance of the casino. He was there every night with different girls. You'd probably miss this fun sight if you stayed just one night but after a few nights it became apparent to me what was going down. Especially after having the girl proposition me a few times.

The cops were a frequent visitor to the property to deal with the various issues in the neighborhood and parking lot. From a new Cadillac being stolen from the parking lot to removing a very intoxicated transient, they had their hands full. Did I mention that this hotel is in a really lousy neighborhood?

In short, this hotel hasn't been renovated since the 80's, and is a dump in a bad area that is littered with hookers and hobos. To top it off, the evening shift staff is rude and unprofessional. 

This property does not live up to Wyndham standards. By far, this is the worst Wyndham property I have ever stayed at. 

This experience has made me reevaluate my loyalty to the Wyndham Rewards program. Why spend as many nights in a Wyndham property to earn an elite status when it apparently means nothing at all?",2017-09-07 15:35:01

First of all, the same man works the desk every single day. Checked in at 7pm, come out at 10am, still there. Come back at 7pm, same man. Wouldn't be so bad if he didn't spend his time arguing with every customer he comes into contact with. When we walked in, he was on the phone arguing with someone. They wanted to switch rooms for whatever reason and he wouldn't allow it. He would also have to 'inspect' the room they were already in to 'make sure they hadn't touched the beds'. the next morning he was full on yelling at a customer at the front desk in front of the whole breakfast crowd. How unprofessional. 
When mentioned there was a truck parked in a handicapped spot without a playcard (illegal) he then argued that it wasn't and that it was his truck AND he had another car parked in another handicapped spot. This guy needs to not be in the customer service business.

Trashy neighborhood with insufficient parking.
Broken toilet.  Everytime my little girl or I flushed, I had to lift the tank lid to manually flush.
No stopper for bathtub and very low water pressure in shower.

Last, the help desk was rude and short on the phone and never delivered a certain item that we requested to our room.

Pros: The front desk is very kind and helpful. There is a full kitchen in the room, the front desk brought us plates, pots, and pans, etc. Large LCD television, closet, two desk chairs, table, desk, recliner,  and basic toiletries.

Cons: Unbelievable creepy feeling, as though I'm being watched in the halls and room. The bed is very hard and uncomfortable. Red portraits around the room are very unwelcoming. Low lighting and flickering bulbs. Thin enough walls that you can hear the next room talk.",2015-01-03 11:45:19

We discovered that $130 had bought us a tiny room and a huge amount of discomfort. As most folks mentioned, the AC is non-existent and opening the windows doesn't make it any more pleasant. We were fairly sure that the carpet was a living fungal colony due to the stickiness of the rug. I'm not even going to get into the bathroom situation, other than the fact that the vent didn't work at all and it was so grungy that they refused to take a shower in it.

I had made a non-refundable, prepaid, one-night reservation for myself and my daughter through Priceline, but I seriously considered leaving and finding something else.  We ended up sleeping there, but I changed our plans so that we spent most of the evening away from the hotel and we checked out early the next morning.

Among the things that bothered me about this hotel:

Grungy carpet, smelled funny.
Hookers in the parking lot.
Trashy neighborhood with insufficient parking.
Broken toilet.  Everytime my little girl or I flushed, I had to lift the tank lid to manually flush.
No stopper for bathtub and very low water pressure in shower.
Unprofessional staff.  At check-in, one of the clerks announced (loudly) to the other, ""She prepaid on Priceline"".  People were staring.
Exterior decorative flashing neon lighting up the sides of building lit up inside of room at night.  I couldn't close drapes enough to fully block it out.
One elevator got stuck (open) on our floor for at least 10 minutes and dinged continually.  Once it finally closed and moved on, I made sure NOT to use it and stuck with the OTHER elevators.
Finally, I was propositioned in an elevator IN FRONT OF MY LITTLE GIRL!!!!.  I mentioned that at check-out, and though the clerk winced, she shrugged it off. 

This is not what I would expect from a Priceline 3-star hotel.  I think it'd be better classified as a ""triple-X"" hotel.  Yuck.  STAY AWAY!",2011-07-25 23:08:57
wgP6nEk0fMRie_spT1jsOw,Cv06__JGeRTH6GLg0Qu9KQ,WoAmi0AaA4HBwWS_MBPuFA,2,1,0,0,"What people need to know is that in this area, this particular hotel is perhaps the only choice for rooms with kitchens, hence the Extended-Stay moniker. Unfortunately, the staff seems to know people don't have much of a choice and don't work towards giving their guests even a mediocre stay.
It *seemed* perfect for our family to converge for a family funeral as it is so close to the George Washington Memorial Park where we needed to attend services and the burial.
On my arrival, I wasn't greeted at all by the front desk staff. I felt like I was intruding on her private time. I forced myself to be pleasant because you get the feeling if you further offend her, she will make you suffer. There were no niceties exchanged, she just wanted to get my last name and get me going ASAP.
My room was ok, though there was a giant cherry red stain on the floor by what is mostly used as a dining table. 
I decided to soak in the tub to attempt to relax and the view of my toilet was disturbing. I attached a pic so you can see the spirit-deflating proof of lax maintenance. My sink was clogged and in desperation I tried using a coffee stirrer to try to snake it (totally unsuccessful). The next day I found out my a/c unit was struggling for survival... it seemed to work about 25% of the time so I spent about 2 days sweating and cursing life, but I was more busy making sure the rest of my family were comfortable.
My parents checked in a day after me. Again the front desk person acted like we were interrupting her from whatever she was doing. It was late, my poor parents were exhausted, yet I had to be overly thankful and patient with the front desk person just to get service.
(Please note that 70% of the time I passed the front desk NO ONE WAS IN VIEW. Several times I saw people waiting to be helped and calling out for some one to help them.)
When my parents got to their room they discovered there was NO TOILET PAPER. This is a basic necessity and it's just CRUEL to make some one have to go suffer the front desk to ask for some toilet paper.
It turns out the front desk person didn't check them in properly and ignored their true reservation because the next morning their cards didn't work and were told they needed to check out. So I had to race back from the AIRPORT to figure out how to get my parents their real reservation and honestly at this point I think the front desk person did this on purpose to make us suffer.
When my uncle and his family arrived (from halfway around the world) I made sure I prepared a gift basket of items so they wouldn't have to interact with the front desk people for fear of thinking everyone in this town was rude and completely service-industry ignorant.
As you can imagine, breakfast was its own nightmare. I had to ask for HOT WATER just to make oatmeal. Over the next 5 mornings, it was a guessing game as to what would be ready and available and no surprise, the front desk weren't visible to ask for help. Other unfortunate guests asking for coffee to be refilled were rudely asked to check the other coffee dispensers first and there was no inclination to go REFILL ANYTHING. There was no point either whether you preferred the dark roast or light roast, they just don't care about you. It is painfully obvious most of the front desk staff hate their job and pretty much hate their guests as an extension. If it wasn't for the laundry or maintenance people who were sympathetic and helpful I wouldn't have gotten help at all. There was absolutely no attempt that I saw that the staff checked to see if all the options listed were available and filled, ready for guests. When things were actually refilled, there was no apology, no rush to service, just the stone cold realization that the staff doesn't give a flying F about you, your stay or your comfort. All you need to know is that you are intruding on THEIR GROUNDS, THEIR TIME and you should feel lucky you are getting any type of service at all.
Also during this week the A/C units were undergoing maintenance so I had to tell my relatives that strangers would be going into their rooms to clean the A/C. Again, not relaxing in the least, although my hope was that mine would actually get fixed and I wouldn't sweat to death in my room.
My last morning I literally gave up and just sat there with a half-filled coffee cup in silence, as the tv had shut itself off again and contemplated just how lame this experience had been.
And some people may think I came into this hotel with some kind of attitude or was impatient or snappish with the staff. That never happened as I'm a pretty humble person and I was exhausted for pretty much of this trip so I was pretty muted but still accepting and friendly. I grew up here so I am familiar with the people and the Philly attitude so I act like a local and am just as willing to kid and joke and build bridges, but wow - was I so disappointed in this hotel.",2018-07-15 17:06:36

My daughter and I stayed at this hotel because of a sporting tournament that she was playing in and the team was given a discounted rate, I'm not sure if $150 to stay in a hotel that's in the middle of nowhere PA is a good rate but it was close to where she was playing so that's where we stayed. First we will start with accessibility to the hotel, getting in and out of the parking lot is ridiculous, it's a maze, I'm not sure why it's set up the way it is. I had driven up from VA early that morning because my daughter's first game was at 8am, she was done with her games by 1pm I figured we go to the hotel and see if we can check in early. Get to the front desk and I asked if I could check in early and the woman at the front desk was a little snippy with her answer, but she did allow us to check in early. Now I reserved the room with my bank card, however, I paid for the room in cash, to prevent payment coming out of my checking acct, the front desk person told me I did NOT need to give her a credit card because I was paying with cash. So we go to our room. The room was your basic hotel room, nothing special. Second reason for the 1 star, the beds were EXTREMELY uncomfortable, hard as rocks, I slept maybe 3hrs that night. Third reason, decided to get breakfast at the hotel because the buffet was a reasonable price (shockingly) and I didn't really have time to go out somewhere, so even though it's a buffet there are servers to bring you drinks and special food items you can order at the buffet. I paid for the meal and tip in advance, I would like my tip back because I had to get everything myself, drinks, food, everything, the food was good though. Now for the final reason I'm giving this place 1 star, so as stated above I paid cash for the room so they wouldn't charge my bank card...well guess what they charged my bank card, and caused my account into the negative! They did this without telling me! I didn't realize I had been charged until I had already checked out and on my way back to VA. When I realized what had been done I immediately called the hotel. Of course the manager was gone and he would call me back the next day. He called me the next day and told me this is something all hotels do even when you pay in cash. Which is completely untrue, as I have paid for hotels many times with cash and they never authorize or charge my credit/bank card. He told me that I would have to contact my bank to have the issue resolved, he apologized and stated that he should be able to refund my stay due to how I was inconvenienced. Called my bank, the authorization was reversed. I asked the manager about my refund and he the said ""oh my manager said that you can't get a refund because you weren't actually charged."" I proceeded to argue with the low manager about how much of an inconvenience and embarrassment it was for me, and all I got was an apology  and basically called a liar when I said that I had paid for hotels in this way many times with many other chains and it had never happened.

First off let me just say that every hotel staff person I interacted with was friendly and helpful, especially the woman who was in charge of the breakfast buffet.

Once you step inside your nostrils are assaulted by the smell of pungent chlorine.  It smells like a chemical shed next to a pool!  When I got to my room I noticed that the blankets on both of the beds had numerous cigarette burns on them.  Gross!  Also the knob in the shower has the ""H"" and ""C"" on the wrong sides- one morning I was in a hurry but could not bring myself to have a cold shower.  Later I discovered that the temperature labels were installed wrong.

They do have a complimentary breakfast and it's okay.  The breakfast room has a large t.v.  I used the exercise room one morning and it's small but it served my purposes.  The treadmill there is ancient and doesn't slow down when you press ""stop"" it just stops!  I almost fell off.  

Dear hotel owner:  Fix the rank chlorine smell, replace your ratty old cigarette burnt blankets, fix your mislabeled showers, and also spray for bugs- I saw a stink bug crawling on some of the fake flowers while I was waiting for my elevator.

The hotel decor is attractive and clean looking. Our beds were comfortable, and breakfast was good. All of our interactions with staff were friendly. Even my children commented on the organization and cleanliness of the breakfast area and the friendliness of the staff. 

I took off one star for the following: 

1. Even though the room was mostly clean, I noticed a little dirt and hair behind the bathroom door. That tells me that housekeeping cleaned the floor, but didn't bother to close the door to clean behind it. 

2. As I passed the front desk on my way back from breakfast, two employees behind the desk were having a conversation, and one was obviously telling the other a story, which didn't bother me. In the course of the story, however, he cursed, using the f word. I found that to be unprofessional, especially for someone behind the front desk.

The ""pool"" is a concrete hole in the ground surrounded by a chain link fence and located smack dab in the middle of the parking lot.  The staff members are completely unprofessional.  If people complained, one member repeatedly told people they weren't staying at the Ritz.  The staff obviously had no dress code.  They were wearing random t-shirts and sweatpants.  The card to get into my room worked only once out of every five swipes.  Other members in our group had similar issues.  One wasn't able to close her window at all (on the first floor) and had to switch hotels because there weren't any other rooms available, and the hotel still charged her for the room.  Another family got locked out of their hotel (with all of their stuff inside) for over an hour while the maintenance people tried to get in.

We called 30 minutes prior and I assumed I talked to a call center for the booking. The lady I talked to was very nice and the booking took literally no longer then 10 minutes. 

When I entered the Extended Stay America Plymouth Meeting at 12:00 AM. The staff was completely rude to other people staying there. I overheard one of the staff member on the phone and one of the people that were staying there about a toilet plunger. Instead of the staff member going to help the person she told them they have to do it themselves by grabbing the plunger and pushing it in and out the toilet. 

After this we checked in, again this was late so we fell right to sleep. The room looked decent but after this experience I will check everything before I rest my head. We ended up going to sleep and waking up at 6AM. He went to the bathroom and called me in there and said the cleaning staff left rags on the shower head. I called the front desk and she told me our room was on a list of rooms that were cleaned. I told her I hope you wouldn't give me a dirty room. She also stated that each room was inspected by the manager after the cleaning. Which clearly was a lie!!!! She then told me that she could not leave the desk because she was the only one and the cleaning crew would be here at 7ish. She said did you want to wait. I said I can't take a shower for an hour. The cleaning people never came by the way, however she did let me know she left a note for the manager. I was very unhappy with this situation. 

We couldn't wait to take a shower and since we didn't have to touch the rags with our hands we showered. As we are showering we look up at the walls above the shower and notice long hair on the walls of the shower(pictures below). We are both African American so our hair is not as loose. After showering we started to inspect more things and notice even the towels had hair on them. I was completely disgusted and unhappy. We checked out at 11. While at the from desk there was a lot of drama. I think someone staying was trying to fight the manager and the cops were called. The staff is laughing and just completely using inappropriate language at the front desk. 

Once we saw the manager she didn't give me a chance to speak she just says we can't refund you ( which is annoying because I would never stay there again and I'm telling all of my friends and family) but they could give me another night for free. 

A few days later they called and asked me to give a positive review. I declined and said I didn't have the cleanest stay there. I also said I was never given any type of compensation. Sorry it took so long to write this but I will never stay here again.",2021-03-03 23:07:57

My brother is handicapped.  He stayed at this hotel last weekend.  We pulled up to the front and there was a SUV in the handicapped parking.  No handicapped plackard or plate.  We motioned to the people to move.  They wouldn't.  We had an altercation with these people and went into the manager of the hotel.  The manager of the hotel had told these people they could park in the handicapped slot because their windows had been broken.  When we complained about it being a handicapped spot, the manager said ""what do you want me to do?""  ""I'm tired and don't want to deal with this"".  Turns out, this was the GM of the hotel.

I don't know how this guest obtained the handicapped plackard, but I do not believe it was legitimate.  If you have a handicapped person in your family, you realize first hand how important such a small thing is to them.  This manager,  Pamela, should be fired over this incident.

I took my sons for a surprise getaway because this hotel had an outdoor pool. When I called ahead to ask about the pool (which I totally understood) Sean at the front desk told me ""yeah you and everyone else is here for the pool."" He was rude as could be.  Upon check-in, he continued to be rude when I couldn't hear him accurately behind a mask and plexiglass glass. The pool was a joke. People from the hotel across the street were constantly walking over to use the pool when the limit was 19 only and everyone at our hotel needed to sign up at a certain time and get a color coded bracelet. However, no one was ever checking bracelets. We watched two birthday parties take place and people getting dropped off for that in addition to the people walking over from the hotel across the street. The pool was packed. On Saturday I winded up taking my kids to Valley Forge for a historical tour since there was no room at the pool. I was OK with that. I wouldn't have taken them in anyway with 50 people out there. Sunday was the other birthday party and  I made my kids go out there because I paid over $300 for this experience. We lasted maybe two hours because of the amount of people. I then just drove them 20 minutes away to play miniature golf and get ice cream. Monday morning we tried again -we signed up from 10 to 1 to go in before checkout, come to find out the pool was now closed for engineering reasons. Ha.  A staff member told another family she thought it was Bc the pool was out of hand and they couldn't control it.  I'm sorry but I never saw anyone try to control it.  It was a huge disappointment and I wrote an email and letter to headquarters. The manager from the hotel called me once and left a message. I returned his call and got once again front desk rude Sean who told me he couldn't take a message but I could leave the message for him on his voicemail (his voicemail box that was full and hung up on me). I called again the next day and the sweet girl Kayla did take my name and number but I haven't heard back yet.  I would avoid this hotel during the next few months until things are back to normal.

Parking @$30 a day was not included. The lobby was cold and unwelcoming and it took a long time to get checked in.

AhshU-eQq-Ajt8pKPcIxFA,-Bmc_ufzHA6Vis9fTOIcAg,grhrDnNaRZCoOX0RCaBNVQ,1,0,0,0,"Booked two advanced reservations for this location. After checking in for the first reservation, it became imperative that I find better living arrangements as quickly as possible.
The location constantly smelt of smoke (cigarettes and weed). Further more the air quality of the building was a disaster for my allergies, causing problems for me particularly when attempting to sleep.
On top of air quality issues, the building was particularly dirty and, in some areas, in a state of disrepair (particularly the stairwells). Additionally there were multiple conversations of property being stolen, the last one before I left being license plates being taken off vehicles in the parking lot.
Overall the one positive thing that can be said for the location is that the staff was for the most part friendly and helpful. The same can't be said for higher up in the company.
With the understanding that advanced bookings had a no refund policy, I reached out to guest relations to request a refund for my second reservation despite said policy due to health and safety concerns that would prevent me from staying in this location. Since the company failed to provide the product advertised (particularly since they list the location as no smoking), I felt that it would be perfectly reasonable to refund the second reservation. Had the conditions of the location been better/healthier, I would have been fine with honoring the second reservation before seeking other living arrangements. Originally this WAS AGREED TO, and a refund was authorized by management. After two weeks of requesting status updates on the refund, I was advised that the refund had been RECANTED. If I had not remained in communication with guest relations, I would never had known this since I never received any notice from management.
I have since been in a loop contacting guest relations about this issue and to request to speak directly to management. Originally the claim was that some one had reached out (which I doubt since I have not received any phone calls, voicemail, or email messages), and if I wish to have management contact me again, they could reopen my case, but I'd have to wait up to 48hrs for a response. I have received this response from guest relations multiple times, but in my last conversation the representative I spoke to acknowledged that my most recent request for response had gone ignored. I have since reported my issue to the Better Business Bureau, but so far ESA management has continued to be uncooperative. I am currently considering options for escalating this matter further.
Avoid this company at all costs. From my experience, dishonesty and neglect are more than acceptable by their standards.",2021-07-06 12:15:29

I always stop myself from posting a review because I always believe in giving more chances. I've never had more than a 2 star experience here wether it be the hot water not working on multiple occasions, rude staff or having to wait well past check in time for a room we booked. Yesterday was the point that got me here. We arrived to check in and the man at the counter took his time doing whatever he was doing before helping us. When he was finally ready for us he just looked up. No hello, no greeting whatsoever. It was awkward to be honest. My boyfriend finally broke the silence and told him we were checking in. He asked for the name and then mumbled something. After having to ask 3 times what he was saying he finally clearly asked for the payment method. My boyfriend handed over his card and said ""oh that's just for the security deposit right"" with the WORST attitude this man said ""no"" I butted in at that point because I don't like attitude and told him we paid on hotels. He said ""no it's not paid for."" Knowing that that wasn't true my boyfriend started checking his bank account while this man was charging his card. On his bank account he could see that he had just been charged the security deposit. When he told me that the man chimes in ""oh yeah it only wanted to take the money for that so I guess we were both wrong"" no sir, YOU were wrong. So we finally get to our room and it's two queens vs the one king we had booked. The main reason for our hotel stays are the king beds. We went down to ask about it and he said ""no we don't have any. You chose the room and it was either two queens or one king."" That was also wrong because it never said anything about TWO queens. It was one queen vs one king. Now this probably wouldn't have been any type of issue if he had been able to be at all nice or even try to look. He simply said ""we're all booked"" and turned around. My boyfriend and I don't have it in us to be rude to anyone working customer service, until they're rude to us so please know we did not deserve the attitude he was giving. We contacted hotels and there was nothing they could do. They tried reaching the front desk and the front desk just didn't answer their call. My boyfriend then called customer service for holiday inn and they were extremely helpful. The woman herself tried to reach the front desk and they didn't answer her either. When we looked on hotels.com there were still rooms available with king beds and the option of one king or one queen. The woman on the phone had explained that it was probably a miscommunication between hotels.com and the hotel itself. I understand that but better communication and better front desk customer service to explain that would've been all it takes. 

Now on to the next problem. This hotel has quiet hours and something about ""we promise no maintenance or housekeeping will be done between these hours."" Around 10:45 you could hear drilling in the room across from us. A loud drill. We weren't going to bed yet so it didn't really matter at the time. For the rest of the night, mostly between the hours of 2:30 to 4:30 there was screaming all throughout the halls. People trying to open every single door on our floor, multiple times. Fights. A large group going to their rooms and a man specifically yelling ""YERRRRRRRR"" down the hall at the top of his lungs. This was non stop between those hours. I wasn't even comfortable enough to call the front desk because even if they had answered, they had already been extremely rude. The last thing I want to note is that our room was barely cleaned. We found a pair of someone's socks rolled up..... right in the chair. To end this I'd like to say, I really hope the blonde lady at the desk is having a great day. And whatever warranted her dirty looks to us the entire time is fixed in her life. Same to the rude man at the desk. I hope whatever made him so miserable is better.",2019-12-08 16:12:04

The room was great as well - clean, had air-conditioning (which is important, because Philly's weather was horrible this week!), but the reason I am only giving it two stars is because the ladies who are currently working the front desk. At check-out they were BEYOND rude. 

My co-worker and I asked for a snack bag for the road (because they had been out ALL week in the mornings) - they replied that ""sorry that's only Monday - Friday. Proceeded to put their heads down. 

I explained ""Oh sorry! We were here for the whole week for the conference, have a 5hr drive, and actually asked someone yesterday if the snack baga would be available tomorrow (Saturday) - to which they replied ""yes"". 

The front desk ladies proceeded to say ""no, we don't have them on Saturday's""... They literally laughed at us like we were dumb, and then just looked down again and proceeded to ignore us (again). 

Ok.... so my colleague and I proceeded to return to our room, to get out luggage. 

However, really??? Seeing as how we just spent a FORTUNE staying here for a week at $300 bucks a night... Could you spare a snack bag or two???

I was actually bragging about this place at my conference and how amazing the staff was - and to leave on this note, literally feeling laughed at - ignored - and not appriciated as a guest... Was really unfortunate. 

I understand that you might not give out the travel bags on the weekends - Ok - no problem, but to respond in that manner? Or not even try and say, we can do this instead since you were informed incorrectly, etc... 

Just really horrible horrible service - I have actually never left a hotel feeling this way, which is sad because the whole week prior and the people were wonderful!",2018-06-02 11:32:01

I took my sons for a surprise getaway because this hotel had an outdoor pool. When I called ahead to ask about the pool (which I totally understood) Sean at the front desk told me ""yeah you and everyone else is here for the pool."" He was rude as could be.  Upon check-in, he continued to be rude when I couldn't hear him accurately behind a mask and plexiglass glass. The pool was a joke. People from the hotel across the street were constantly walking over to use the pool when the limit was 19 only and everyone at our hotel needed to sign up at a certain time and get a color coded bracelet. However, no one was ever checking bracelets. We watched two birthday parties take place and people getting dropped off for that in addition to the people walking over from the hotel across the street. The pool was packed. On Saturday I winded up taking my kids to Valley Forge for a historical tour since there was no room at the pool. I was OK with that. I wouldn't have taken them in anyway with 50 people out there. Sunday was the other birthday party and  I made my kids go out there because I paid over $300 for this experience. We lasted maybe two hours because of the amount of people. I then just drove them 20 minutes away to play miniature golf and get ice cream. Monday morning we tried again -we signed up from 10 to 1 to go in before checkout, come to find out the pool was now closed for engineering reasons. Ha.  A staff member told another family she thought it was Bc the pool was out of hand and they couldn't control it.  I'm sorry but I never saw anyone try to control it.  It was a huge disappointment and I wrote an email and letter to headquarters. The manager from the hotel called me once and left a message. I returned his call and got once again front desk rude Sean who told me he couldn't take a message but I could leave the message for him on his voicemail (his voicemail box that was full and hung up on me). I called again the next day and the sweet girl Kayla did take my name and number but I haven't heard back yet.  I would avoid this hotel during the next few months until things are back to normal. And try to avoid Sean. I think he needs a new job.",2020-07-25 23:30:37

I was intrigued so I peaked out from behind my friends, the bum looks at  me and says ""cover your ears"" and he continued ""there is an excellent titty bar across from here"". Good to know?

Bf & I were in one room, our friends were in an adjacent, but not conjoined, room (11th floor, they ""ran out of conjoined rooms"" even though we requested it a month in advance). Crumbs and such on the carpet (bf said he could feel little objects under his feet since he was walking around in socks, instead of wearing flip flops like me). One of the lamps didn't have a light bulb in it, which was fine since there were 4 other lamps. Our room didn't have a ""do not disturb"" sign, so I called the front desk for one, the lady who answered said ""uhhhhhh...okay....."" and hung up (unprofessional), 10 mins later our sign arrived at our door (btw, the sign loves to fly off every time you open the door) The bed was large, big enough to fit 3 people comfortably, but it was stiff. Pillows were small but pretty fluffy. There were long dark hairs on one of the 4 pillows, I just pulled them off (at least they weren't pubic).There was a fold-out couch, old TV but at least it was a decent size and had enough channels to keep me entertained. Huge window, great view, had a set of sheer curtains and a set of thick curtains so not a single ray of sunlight came through in the morning. AC worked perfectly, there were like 3 settings so you could choose to have your room warm, a comfortable temperature, or completely freezing. The hallway leading to the room was always hot & humid so entering the room was a nice treat.
The bathroom was decent. The shower curtain was definitely worn out (it's part plastic, part fabric, and the plastic part had so many rips). Water pressure was good, but the shower head made the water spray out in like 5 awkward streams, so I turned it to see what other options I had, but it was either that or 1 terribly hard stream in the center. The soap/lotion/shampoo smelled nice (""sugared citrus"") but I preferred to use my own.

So we went to our friends' room to hang out and the first thing I noticed was a dirty rolled-up sock on the ground by the bed, in plain sight. Disgusting. How did house keeping miss that? It didn't bother the guys, so oh well. Their room had two beds, I would say they could each fit 2 people comfortably. There was no couch. The toilet & sink were completely different than the ones in our room, which I thought was a little weird since hotel rooms are usually uniform.

The walls are pretty thin, I could hear our friends in the next room, and the people on the other side of us. When our AC was off, it was like they were talking right next to me.
No continental/complimentary breakfast, but it's not listed on their website so I didn't expect it anyway.
There's a casino right across from the lobby. It's dinky. It smells of smoke but not as bad as Vegas. There's a 24 hr snack bar thing in the casino, though we didn't eat there. It's nice to know you have access to food all day, errrrryday.
I liked seeing people walking around the hotel with their dogs. Made me miss my dog. According to other reviews, this hotel is pet-friendly.

$55 per night for the room, plus state sales tax & local tax. State sales tax is 7.72% and local tax is 5.28% (doesn't have the percentages on the receipt so I calculated it for you guys).
Overall, the bad outweighs the good: poor customer service, dirty rooms, the entire hotel needs an update (not just the rooms), blah blah blah. I stayed here because an event I attended was being held here, but I would definitely not stay here again.",2012-08-21 04:38:59

It was a last minute Philly trip, we got to philly at 10 pm, we have two young kids so we just needed to sleep somewhere. We thought ok, a hotel that cost $155/night shouldn't be that bad right? nope. WRONG. We were very greeted by a very rude and unpleasant receptionist that doesn't even say hi, thank you, or enjoy your stay. Oh doesn't even bother to explain that there is only 1 elevator to the rooms nor if the hotel have a wifi available. 

Then we went to our floor and the smell...ugghhh the smell! it reeks of cigarrete and feces smell. okay... maybe it won't be so bad in the room...oh not to mention the carpet in the hall is soo gross. At one point we saw what looks like a puke stain in the hallway. Then we got to our room. The kitchen looks like it should stay in the 80s. Questionable gunk was all over the electric stove. Pungent smell coming from the fridge, stains on the countertops. The room smells even worse than the hallway! I took off the bedsheet to see what is underneath...stains all over the waterproof cover of the mattress. At that point my husband asked me do you want to stay here? I was beyond exhausted, my kids were exhausted and it was very late at night. I made a stupid stupid decision to stay and suck it up...it was just to sleep and we will leave first thing in the morning. Bad, bad decision on my part. 

Then as you see in my pictures how bad the condition in the bathroom...I wanted to puke. I had to shower with my sandal on, and my kids definitely get any bath or shower in that disgusting bathroom. The smell of cigarrete at this point is irritating my asthma and acid reflux. I had trouble sleeping all night long. My kids were just as cranky. 

The  as I was laying down on the bed, I looked up and saw a plastic bag covering the smoke detector. ahhh no wonder ppl get away with smoking here. But as hotel staffs, why aren't you guys doing anything? this is the middle of pandemic still so I freaking doubt you take any type of precautions to clean and sanitize your rooms properly!! oh did I also mention that the entire floor and rooms are supposed to be nonsmoker rooms?? Did I also mention that the tv in our room didn't work? 

I rather walk around the hospital barefoot with risk of MRSA on the floor than walk around in that room barefoot!

We took pictures before taking it to the front desk. The clerk said he would show it to the manager. We were visibly upset and went to continue packing. When we returned to the desk no mention was made of the incident. When I asked about it the clerk said they had the exterminator there on Tuesday. Period. I felt like I was being called a liar. Being upset and having a nine hour drive ahead I let it drop. I am furious. The manager could have spoken to us or at least had the clerk offer an apology. There were other problems that I was going to overlook. On Wednesday about 5 PM to 6 PM they were hammering on the wall next to our room - while I was trying to read. The description online said there was a restaurant on premises. It was closed. When I called these issues to the clerk's attention he said they had notified corporate that they were remodeling and it wasn't their problem.
After returning home I submitted a complaint on Choice Privileges website and received a note that it was received and I would be contacted within 72 hours. That time has come and long gone. I also contacted the customer relations person at the hotel and received no response. They totally ignored us. And we are Choice Privileges Gold members! So we are not chronic whiners and scammers.

We had to ask for that and even then it was a tiny one. The hotel staff was some of the rudest staff I've met. They didn't do anything for us. They never ONCE laundered our room.

We went to do laundry later at night, after we were told it was working, etc. sure it was working but the laundry detergent was also GONE. Again, GO BUY SOME. Also the ""business center"" which was a computer from about 2002 and a printer, didn't even work. We had to email HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL documents to the main desk to print out. Do we know if she deleted those documents? Nope. When we asked about ANY of the above we were always treated with an ""I don't know "" or ""we don't have that"" something along those lines. NOTHING to help us solve any problems. Again our room wasn't even serviced once, even when we asked for it. It was gross after 2 weeks. The room itself is ok even though the heater worked when it felt like it. So sometimes it would be freezing, other times sweltering. Sometimes it would wake you up in the middle of the night because it was so loud. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you STAY ELSEWHERE if you are in Willow Grove. There are several other hotels in that area.

Wife argued with me at first, but then I showed her the expired inspection card in the rickety elevator and she came to. Then, we entered the room. The odor - my gawd - the odor. It was as if a 20-year-old dumpster cat had vomited moth balls across a North Philly street corner. 

We cranked the ventilator, which actually worked, and passed out. But not before I stacked a bunch of bags on the window to keep the curtain from sucking up all the fresh air. Seriously.

All unapologetically rude; perhaps this corporation treats its staff as well as it designs rooms for guests.

The day of my reception, guests had trouble conducting early check-in, even though they called and confirmed earlier. The rooms were in poor condition (wall paper pealing off the walls, shades that won't go up or down, dirty toilets, faulty room keys, etc). The hotel staff was dismissive and rude.

Let's start with the good... The location was very convenient, the price was great and the room was a nice size (does need an upgrade and had a strange layout). Front desk associates were really friendly when we checked in at 7:00 pm on a Friday night and provided us with complimentary toothbrushes and toothpaste since we conveniently left ours at home. 

Now the so-so... The hotel stated that it had a pool, however neglected to mention that the pool could only comfortably fit 5 people. Fortunately, my kids were the only ones who wanted to get in so it worked out and the pool itself was heated. The fitness center was small enough to fit 4 treadmills and they all awkwardly faced the pool so anyone attempting to workout was forced to watch the kiddy pool and vice versa. 

The bad... since there were 4 of us, I had to get a room with 2 beds. These beds were only doubles and not comfortable for 2 adults. There was a TV, but it sat against a wall in between the bedroom and the living room so that you could watch from either side. There was no door separating the two rooms. The Durham, NC SpringHill had a door AND 2 televisions. The complimentary breakfast was major chaos. They didn't have nearly enough tables to fit visitors; 3 of us played musical chairs and stuffed ourselves into 2 seats at a tiny table that was covered in syrup (the only open spot in the whole area). I put a lot of napkins down to make a semi table cloth so that my kids wouldn't be sticky messes. The layout of the breakfast area made it very difficult for more than one person to be in the same area. When I was getting oatmeal, I was simultaneously blocking the apple/orange juice machine. Grabbing plates/utensils and blocking the bread and English muffin case. Also, each platter of food was almost empty or completely empty.

The shower curtain was either too small or the rod didn't have the Peet's to hold it so that it would stay put while you could take your shower without it opening. The TV satellite connection on most stations was horrible and there were no movie stations for a hotel that cost over 200.00 per night.

There was some sort of glitch with the hotels computer system not communicating with Chase.  It declined my credit card so I paid him for the room in cash but then I still had to give him $75 more for the room deposit just in case.  I called Chase while I was standing in front of the most obnoxious condescending man I've ever had to deal with by the name Patrick.  He kept repeating loudly.... several times that it had been declined it had  been declined it had been declined ....loudly enough that other people in the lobby heard him!  I certainly expect much better of any person in the hotel industry but to be treated so rudely and disrespectfully when it was his error not mine or my credit card company's that caused the problem!  While I had the credit card person on the phone she said that Chase had not received any (zero) communication from Embassy suites and had not declined the card she suggested he go out of his system and start the transaction from the beginning when he did that surprise surprise it went right through without an issue.

He said he'd speak to Patrick, but honestly I do not feel he put much thought into our conversation and seemed to want to end it. I understand, I'd not want to listen to me bitch either!

1. So glad to see that the average rating is a deservedly 1 star.
2. If i could give it a 0 star... you get the drift.

1. The curtains do not fully cover the window. As a result, bright, white street light shines through the window after your turn off the lights. Try to get a good night with that!

2. No power outlets! I counted. There are 3 outlets/6 sockets in my king bed room. 1 outlet is behind the bed. 1 outlet is behind the TV. 1 outlet is under the desk in the corner. These are the worst places to put outlets. Furthermore, there are 4 lights and 1 TV in the room, so 5 out of the 6 sockets are used up. The unused socket is behind the TV. If you've got multiple devices to charge up, you need to bring your own power strip!

3. Room service disrupted my sleep everyday!!! I stayed there for 3 days. Everyday, I had the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door knob. Every morning, around 9am, the service man would bang my door and yell ""hello? hello?"" until I got up, opened the door, and told him that I didn't want any room service. Why would he do that? Doesn't he understand the meaning of the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign? Here is my theory. In most hotels/motels, room service teams start cleaning in the morning. But, they keep coming back throughout the day, because some customers wake up really late, take down the signs, and expect their rooms to be cleaned. So, in most hotels, room service teams would work in and out until late afternoon, until all the rooms that need cleaning are cleaned. In this hotel, the room service man (the same fucking dude) doesn't want to come back in the afternoon. He doesn't want to check if your signs will be put down. He wants to do morning shift only. So, he doesn't mind ruining your mornings just to confirm that you don't expect a room service later in the day. Guess what? You don't see the room service team ever in the afternoon.

4. ""Continental Breakfast"" is what you would expect in a homeless shelter. They should change their sign to say ""Breakfast"". The current sign, which says ""Continental"", is misleading customers.

Two ups:
1. The security guards are very courteous, making up for the bad attitudes of the front desk people.

The wedding was lovely and the rooms were decent but the service, particularly the manager i dealt with at the front desk, was unfortunately (for me) unsatisfactory in her performance and a bit rude.  

The criticism i have for the staff is that are either not trained well and/or just don't care about what they're doing.  First about the manager I dealt with though. On Sat. during the wedding we were on i believe the second floor in one of the ballrooms. Internet was not available (i need it to check emails for work).  I ended up going to the front desk. I explained that during the wedding i needed internet access to check my emails for work. What I got was, ""you only get internet here in the lobby and in your room. If you want Internet in the ballroom you need to speak with a Business Specialist"". Basically, unless i was renting a conference room with the hotel i wasn't allowed access to their wifi.  Granted, i would have needed internet access on the Ballroom floor for a good 4-4.5 hours but NOPE, this manager could not have been bothered to give me the access code for those 4 hours. She essentially said to rent a conference room if i wanted internet access or get lost and seemed to have taken pleasure in letting me know that she would not be helping me. Now recall, that we stayed in the hotel for two nights (weren't just there the day of the wedding).

The next incident was minor but i believe it needs to be mentioned. The morning after the wedding my family and i met in the Executive Lounge for breakfast around 9am. It was fairly crowded as expected (popular time).  Directly next to our table one of the staff decided to start sorting and placing the silverware which was VERY NOISY.  Now, i have no issue with the actual act as i know it' part of her job but did she not realize the noise was great and she was directly next to us? She obviously did not because this went on for a good five minutes and i found it to be quite disturbing. She was very nice so i don't think it was intentional but i do think it's not appropriate to be doing that inches away from a table of people trying to eat their breakfast and enjoy time together. Most likely it did not occur to her or perhaps someone could have figured out that maybe that wasn't the best place to do such a thing but it happened and i did not appreciate it at the time.  

Was the hotel itself decent? All in all, yes (nice location). Was it the hotel's staff decent? I'd say sadly that they were subpar in my experience.  Would I use them again or recommend them? Probably not.",2018-05-29 16:19:41

I called the day before (6/2/16) to confirm our reservation and ensure the room would be ready for our 3pm check-in so we would be on time for the wedding we were there to attend. I also stated that we would be using the sofa bed and would need that to be prepared with linens as well. 
We arrived to the hotel at approximately 2:45 pm and were told our room was not ready for our 3 pm check in and would not be ready until 3:45 pm which made us late for the wedding we were attending. When we attempted to speak to the supervisor, Michelle, she blatantly ignored us. We again attempted to speak to her and she yelled at us ""we're overbooked""! I want to be clear that Michelle was unprofessional and literally yelled at us. 
When we first arrived to our room, there was food all over the floor in the hallway and directly in front of our door. When we left the next day, the food was still there. The hallway was never cleaned. 
After entering our room we immediately realized there was no bedding for the sofa bed; we called down to ensure this would be taken care of before we returned after the wedding. After returning to the room after the wedding the bedding was not provided and we had to call down 4 times before we received adequate linens; please note that staff had to return to the room twice before everything was provided. 
We were charged $200 for our one night stay. The customer service was substandard and in fact rude and hostile. The accommodations and service were also substandard, unsanitary and totally unacceptable. This was not a $200 a night hotel.

Room was not clean properly: drapes are heavily dusty, thick layer of dirt on base boards, bathroom was disgusting: some sort of sticky stuff was on the bathtub floor, sink had soap and toothpaste left overs. Most horrific was finding hair (not mine) all over the sheets and pillows. Breakfast items were not fresh. But that was not all! I tried to speak with a manager and was offered a receptionist instead. After describing what I saw, she assured me that manager will call or e-mail to me that night. After a couple of days, not hearing back, contacted hotel again. Same result. Then decided to chat with Hilton Honors customer service department.  Nice lady, very understanding and sympathetic. I was told the property will be contacted and somebody will get back to me soon. In a couple of days received a reply: ""The hotel advised that the Head Housekeeper, the Owner, and Manager all walked the 4th floor and all rooms were cleaned which they advised yours was also included in the walk through."" Where they all have been on the day I checked in? Obviously not there because room was in shape I found it.

I would have actually rated this hotel a zero if that were an option. This negative rating is primarily based on an extremely negative customer service experience, although the amenities also lacked. 

I had my family coming in for a three day volleyball tournament and made a reservation on points months in advance. I checked in on-line for the first night 24 hours before my expected arrival but was unable to actually show up at the hotel until the second day of my 3 day reservation. The hotel cancelled the entire reservation and did not tell me it was cancelled. When I saw on my mobile app that the reservation was cancelled I called the hotel and they stated that they were able to get me back in but neglected to tell me it was not on points anymore but I was being charged a full room rate. When I found this out at the hotel they were completely unsympathetic to the issue and refused to take any accountability for this mishap. The general manager was unwilling to do anything to help in the interest of customer satisfaction and was quite impatient and clearly could not give a damn about helping me out in any manner.  I also reviewed the link to the referenced terms for an on-line check-in and it does not state your entire reservation will be cancelled if you opt to show up later in your reservation period (which sounds like I have a basis for a legal claim as I was harmed financially and my family was harmed emotionally by this experience!)

With regard to the hotel itself.....basic perhaps slightly spartan amenities in the room.  The breakfast food was a low quality continental breakfast with limited variety and those eggs you wonder if they came from a chicken egg or box. The bacon was ok....but who can do bacon wrong?  

The pool is indoors and the chlorine content in the air was noticeable as soon as I walked into the pool room. I had to leave after 10 minutes and I could still smell the chlorine on me the next day even after taking a shower.

So you might wonder why I stayed at the hotel long enough to taste the not so lovely breakfast and expose myself to high levels of chlorine? Well....After realizing they cancelled my points reservation and they were charging me a room rate (and of course after talking to the general manager)  it was clear that if I left they would have charged me an early cancellation fee of one more night along with the points they already deducted for the first night stay on my original reservation.  I'd be screwed either way. The cancellation fee plus new last minute hotel reservations elsewhere seemed even worse although in hindsight I wish I did the right thing and leave this lousy hotel.",2018-05-10 14:50:57

The staff gets 4 stars.  They were kind enough I suppose.  Only thing stopping them from 5 stars is that I checked in quickly and ran back out to dinner with co workers. I quickly dumped my stuff in my room and took off.  Upon return I went to go to my room and the keys wouldn't work.  When we went back to the desk to get them redone thinking we deactivated them, they said they were shut off because my card declined.  Fair enough.  I'll use a diff card.  Just a little bothered that I wasn't called or anything to let me know I'd go up to my room only to come right back down to start over again.  (Keep in mind this is cutting into my very limited anniversary time).  Just sucked that there was no communication for that. 

Room is 3 stars.  It was cold, which was very much appreciated when it's 100 degrees outside. Room had a lot of small things that were either odd or just plain ignored as a problem aesthetically.  I'll be putting up pics of the few things in a bit. 

Bed was comfy.  4 stars.  A little disturbing that the headboard had a GREASY footprint smeared on it.  

Bathroom 3 stars. It was clean and the lighting was good.  Only thing is the tub had paint peeling, a weird vent in the shower wall (with no switch to activate a fan if that's what it was), the towels were thrown in the spots where they go and toilet paper was mixed in them. Idk. That's just another weird thing. 

Tv was 5 stars as it has a&e. We were able to catch LIVE PD

Apparently, after already booking my stay here, a friend let me know that this hotel is known for its ""shortstays"" and hourly rates for sketchy characters. And it only took one look around this hotel for me to believe him.

Just from check-in, I knew we'd have a problem. The guy at the front desk was very rude and impatient. He wasn't the accommodating, welcoming type we've gotten used to as Hilton Honors members. But we were in town for just one night and didn't want to bother paying Hilton prices so we tried here. I guess that's what we get. I mean I wasn't expecting Hilton AT ALL but staying here isn't even like a cozy neighbors house. There seems to be no kind of knowledge of hospitality.

Let's start with the fact that my non smoking room smelled like smoke, I used toilet paper to cover the toilet every time I had to pee, and me nor my bf felt brave enough to actually sleep under the covers or shower here. The carpet looks like it hasn't been changed or cleaned since 1972. The dingy bed comforter has a similar look and overall dankness. No fresh hotel whites here.

The restaurant inside the hotel advertises a dinner special, but not everything comes as advertised. The special includes asparagus, yet zucchini is given. This happened again a few days later. I don't understand why the menu wasn't changed if it's impossible to deliver what's advertised. 

My room was clean, but there were no dirty clothes bag to put my dirty stuff in and there wasn't a spare roll of toilet paper in the room. These are all small things to complain about, but when it adds up and I'm having to spend my own time on getting things that I shouldn't have to be doing, it starts to get annoying.

The fitness center has some really nice equipment. It happened to be out of handy-wipes to wipe down a machine before use. I went to the front desk and asked if they could send someone to refill it. That someone never showed up and no one followed up to verify it was taken care of. I don't know about you, but I prefer a clean machine prior to using them because many people are rude and do not clean up after themselves after using a piece of gym equipment. 

Parking is atrocious and whether or not you get your parking validated for the week, the automated machine still eats your ticket where you have to keep going back to the front desk to have the new one validated. SMH!

And finally, when I booked my reservation, I purchased the premium internet package as a part of my booking. After check-in, I called down to the front desk to ask how it worked. Simply choose the Premium Wi-Fi connection, agree to the $10 fee, enter your room number and name and voila. The premium internet is far from premium. It's jut as slow as the standard sign-on, yet they market it anyway. My frustration came upon checkout where Shenaykay tried to charge me for each day I used the premium internet. I explained I purchased the premium as a part of booking and she insisted they didn't offer that at their location. So I asked her why Hilton sold me the package.  She said she didn't know. So I showed her in the app how the room was booked and THEN she believed me. Chalk this up as just another annoyance. 

Two good things about this establishment. The breakfast chef, Vince. He is always bright and cheerful and can make anything you want for breakfast. What a great guy and he has such a positive attitude helping everyone begin their day with a smile. The other is waitstaff, Kendra. She has great customer service and would go out of her way to make sure everything was a pleasurable experience while dining in the hotel restaurant. Both of these individuals may serve the rest of the team well if they were to be training other staff. GREAT JOB TO BOTH OF THESE FANTASTIC PEOPLE!

Wish I could give it zero stars...this was the second worst hotel stay of my life, after one that my parents chose back in 1996 for a ski trip in upstate New York...they were greedy and thought it would be cool to book FOUR wedding blocks in the SAME weekend this past weekend, while construction was going on (the bride and groom told us the hotel never told them about construction that would be happening during the height of the travel season in our country um hello August, why not do the construction in freaking January or February?), with ONE elevator working which moved at the speed of smell and took you up when you asked it to take you down, NO FREE BRUNCH?!?!?!, servers were rude and nasty and I had to eat with my hands and wipe them on my jeans since there were no utensils or napkins and no one was bussing the tables, the hallways needed vacuuming as I literally could see with my naked eye piles of actual dirt in the corners on the carpets!, our room smelled massively strongly of hardcore cleaning agents, fantastic for people with autoimmune diseases and allergies...my husband was the best man for one of those weddings and we didn't even get to check in until almost midnight, and now we see that they double-charged us (the lady at the desk insisted that I present my credit card, even though my husband had earlier and the room was booked in his name?).  Half of our friends didn't have towels or soap, let alone were placed near each other Christ on a cracker.  This is why Philadelphia just is not as together as New York City.

The food was okay; the bartender was great, and the customer service was hit and miss. We arrived late after booking online - when we arrived at the hotel we confirmed with the night manager that we would be receiving the corporate rate that we'd booked with. I'll get back to that. 

Our first room was a disaster. The AC panel was hanging off the wall and when I attempted to open the window the whole thing came out of the sill - not a small or lightweight ginormous window may I add. Also? Being of diamond status we should have gotten a snack package as well - hey guess what? Nothing. And the hotel doesn't have any food past a certain time. Fantastic. After a long day of travel sure we'd LOVE to go back out and hunt for food. 

We requested to change rooms and they said they'd let us know around midday when people had checked out. They called my husband & said that they did have a room; I specifically asked if I had to pack up our stuff and move and he said no, they told him we could do it when he returned from his meetings. 3P comes (now mind you, I work ""from home"" so I'm in the room working) and I receive a call from the front desk asking if we still plan to switch rooms. I say yes we do, thank you. Five minutes later he calls me back (I was told his name is Paul Klatt) and he very rudely asked when I'd be down to pick up the keys. I answered that my husband isn't here, I have two peoples worth of stuff and nothing is packed. He called again and I told him I was packing but again, two people's worth of stuff and me, alone. I asked if I could come down and get the keys yet still get back into my room to transfer items. Answer? No. He said he could send up a cart to help and I said sure but I'm still packing. 30 seconds later there's a knock at the door. I was pretty angry at this point that i had to close up shop in the middle of my work day and deal with such a rude person. I told him I wasn't done and closed the door. He left the cart and was gone. 

So now all of our personal items are out in the hall - yet I carry the laptops and other sensitive things down with me to fetch the keys. I looked at him and asked who was going to help me with the cart. He huffed that he would. He left the cart at the door and left. The cart didn't move for 2 days. We looked into a hotel downtown and confirmed we could check out of this hellhole without a charge. They were ""nice"" and waived the fee for us. 

The icing on the cake? They didn't give us the corporate rate as promised. When my husband called to refute the front desk rudely told him that they couldn't change it; that we had booked it invoking our ""Diamond status"" and therefore couldn't have the other rate. Funny because we asked about this before checking in. 

Avoid this place at all costs.",2012-10-17 03:55:19

Well I have, and unfortunately the Embassy Suites could not help me with that! After my nice rainy walk to the nearby Courtside Marriott to get said ""cup of joe"" I returned to my towel-less room to prepare to shower. I then had my buddy call the lobby for some towels, let's just say the pleasure of speaking to one of the rudest individuals was all his to continue this dreadful experience. Ten minutes later, when the towels were delivered, we decided to order pizza from our nearby tour bus to try to put a, which seemed unrealistic at the time, smile on our faces. The pizza came and we thought it was a great idea to go enjoy it in the beautiful lobby which looked very inviting, boy were we wrong! Another extremely rude individual told us that the 24 empty tables were not for outside food, but our room was. We then walked back through the rain to our bus, that if was equipped with a shower, would have spared us the nightmare of a morning that the ""Embassy Sours"" was so stoked to provide us.

Right off the batt I was surprised with a fee for ""possible damages"" of $100 that I was told would be refunded to me in 10 days after my check out (fine but I was not informed of this until after my card was ran) and the lady at the front desk Silvia was rude when I questioned the charge.

Next my parents where told that breakfast was included with their rooms but it was $32 for the both of them which they discovered at check out..

The ""wedding planner"" that was provided by the hotel was confused when the ceremony came around about the order of things even after we rehearsed the ceremony several times the day prior.

The hotel originally told my sister-in-law that they would provide a 24 person shuttle to and from the reception location then changed that out for 2/10 person vans that where 30 minutes late picking up guests. 

Lastly the parking lot was covered in snow and ice when it snowed 4 days prior... not impressed at all!",2017-03-21 00:47:26

She offered me a regular double room. I refused because I paid for a suite. She offered me a king room. Again, I had paid for a suite. Also, I have an 11 year old with me so how is a king room going to help? She called over a manager who then offered me a king suite. I explained a king won't work as I have a child with me. He told me she could sleep on the pullout couch. Fine, I take the room. 

After that, it only gets worse. Basically, they had no pillows or blankets for the couchbed. Then found some at midnight and brought them to my room, despite the DND sign on the handle.

Teresa helped me look for the bartender and when she came around it was 8:56pm and said the kitchen was closed. She came on very strong without letting me speak. When she stopped, I said ""I just want the chicken tenders"" and she said she closed the kitchen.

uSta-4LbByDNj25wVXbETw,I1EgPLhRNeCNgkK5w0cDLQ,55uWj7Gv6_KrQNWZCHQAug,1,1,0,0,"Not sure how anyone could rate this hotel more than a 3, and then only if they paid Motel6 prices ($40 or $50).  My stay  in 3/2016 was $100, and it was absolutely nowhere near that value.  I stay at hotels 40 to 100 nights a year, mostly for work, and I like the LQ properties in most places.  I have stayed at all 4 LQ's in Tucson.  This one always has the highest rates, and in the photos, it looks like it may be the best LQ, but it definitely is the worst of the 4.  I usually stay closer to my clients, but this was a last-minute trip, and this hotel did have rooms, so I tried it out.  (In case you are wondering, the one listed as Marana at I-10 and Cortaro is by far the best--clean, friendly/competent, long-time employees, great management, fairly safe neighborhood & can usu get a rate less than $90).  The Airport LQ is next--also very nice and well run, but a little out of the way.)  I would NEVER stay here again, even at a much lower rate.  Here's why:  

1.  Safety:   This LQ near Reid Park and the one on E. Broadway are both in very dangerous neighborhoods.  The parking lot here is dark and scary, so if you bring a dog and need to take it out at night, be on high alert and go with a crowd to be safe.  Photos on the web site make it look safe, and I didn't know much about this part of Tucson beforehand, but I did not feel safe here.  The exterior door nearest my room never closed.  Something kept it from shutting unless you pushed it very hard.  So I felt like people in this scary neighborhood could easily enter the hotel any time.  
2.  BUGS:  I can't recall ever before seeing a bug in a LQ before, but when I was ready for bed, I saw the biggest cockroach I've seen in a long time--at least 2"" or maybe 3"" long.  Looked too big to safely squash with a shoe and reminded me of the giant flying cockroaches called palmetto bugs in Florida.  Went to get my phone to photograph it, and when I returned it was gone.  I looked all around the room and couldn't find it and just figured it may have gone into another room, so why change rooms after all that, and I was too tired to try to find another hotel.  
3.  Cleanliness:  Carpets throughout are absolutely filthy, and everything is stinky like sweat and feet. Absolutely gross--felt like my shoes were sticking to carpet, which was covered with dingy splotches, both in the room and in the halls.  The carpet didn't appear to be worn out, so they probably just don't clean it.  Every surface in my room was dirty.  In the counter area near the M/W, everything had sticky smears as if someone had spilled syrup and it wasn't cleaned.  In rest of the room, disgusting smears were on every surface--blobs of stuff that hadn't been cleaned at all, plus smears, as if someone tried to wipe down the tables and counters but didn't do a good job, so they just smeared everything.  I bring a small spray bottle of cleaner, which I used everywhere.  
4.  Furniture:  As a business traveler, I look for hotels with desks and WIFI.  The WIFI worked mostly OK, but the desk was falling apart.  All 4 legs were nearly torn off to the point where the least touch caused it to sway.  I didn't sit on anything except a desk chair covered with a bath towel.  
5.  Lighting: Lighting at the desk was good (but couldn't use it because the desk was falling apart).  Lighting in the bathroom was OK.  Lighting elsewhere was insufficient.  
6.  Staff:  Nice young lady at the front desk in the morning, pleasant woman handling breakfast in the morning, & several maintenance staff I saw were friendly and always asked if they could help me, which is unusual for maintenance.  However, every other front desk clerk was rude, surly, angry at being asked simple questions, and obviously unhappy with their jobs.  In fact, the night clerk was aggressively angry when I came to the huge front entrance area after taking my dog out.  I had exited the hotel from a side entrance and didn't want to go back into that door because people were hanging around in the neighborhood in that area, so I kept walking toward the front of the hotel, but the big glass entry doors were locked and there wasn't a keycard entry there!  I knocked on the door several times before the clerk (mean lady with long black hair) put down her magazine & stomped over the front door, opened it, asked why I was coming to that door, and then complained that I should never use the front door at night--only the side doors.  Really?  Even if that were true, shouldn't someone have told us that or posted a sign?  The others I saw at the front desk later and at checkout were equally obnoxious.",2016-03-12 20:48:10

I didn't put it all together until my wife and guests became aware of what she was referencing and told me after I left the front desk area.

Even lower quality hotels give renovation-related information on their properties. The Mgr.

We had to constantly ask for them to be cleaned or the RUDE housekeeping would be knocking on our doors at 4pm asking when they could clean the room, even though I was out of my room the entire morning/afternoon and no one came. Their excuse was that people were checking out that day so they had a priority over us - which is good and fine, but to be coming around to BARELY start cleaning the room at 4pm is unacceptable! 

They claimed to have just shampooed the carpets in the hotel (new hotel shoudln't need to already have that much shampooing done) and it smelled pretty horrible. I dont know what they used to clean it but it definitely did not have a plesant sent.

when i booked this hotel, i was assured that they had a shuttle and that it would pick us up from the airport.  i called to confirm our reservations and how to catch the shuttle again a few weeks before.  once at the airport, i call the hotel and they say that they don't have a shuttle and never did.  they offer to send a town car, though say they don't know if they can pay for it, and it never comes.  i call back twice, and end up stranded at the airport for 1.5 hours, before shelling out $30 for a cab, that the hotel manager refuses to pick up.  classy.  

everytime i asked a staff person a question at the front desk, it was like the first time they'd ever helped a guest.  they didn't know the closest rental car place to their hotel, apparently are unfamiliar with any of the major towns nearby or national parks.  um, what?!  sadly, i'm not joking.


when i complained to the manager at the end of our stay about being woken up every morning by hotel staff noise and being stranded at the airport, she clearly doesn't care at all.  she takes a few bucks off the bill (for the noise, NOT the shuttle which was a really obnoxious mistake on their part) but her attitude really is that she couldn't care less and doesn't want to hear what we have to say.  needless to say, i won't be staying here again.  too many other hotels to choose from, some of which have to care about their customer's experience.

The location is convenient to relatives that live nearby. The experience has always been satisfactory, until this visit. It started with the phone call to the hotel to make the reservation.  The female desk attendant was not rude but was not helpful at all!.  When I  asked if she could match the rates I found on the Internet, she said no those rates are issued to third parties on leftover rooms we haven't booked yet. I asked if that meant they had no rooms available and her comment was simply ""no we have rooms available at the higher rate"". I booked the room anyway.

When we arrived I was concerned to see the person at the desk was this same woman. She did not disappoint me and continued with the same attitude she shared with me on the phone. We didn't have our Hilton honors number with us and her 30 second attempt to find it was less than impressive. 

The kicker of the evening was connecting to the WiFi. The hotel has contracted with a third-party to manage their WiFi. When it didn't work this desk clerk offered no help and gave me a phone number to call and get it worked out myself. I call the number and the first thing the agent asked me was if I was able to connect the the hotel website.  I had not seen any instructions about that up until then. I tried and it didn't work. The agent then asked me for the Mac address of the device I was trying to connect with!.  REALLY? HAMPTON YOU THINK I AM GOING TO DO THAT OVER THE PHONE?

Get it right, Hampton Inn. 1. Give your desk attendant some customer service training and 2. Write up some instructions on how to connect to your WiFi and put it in the rooms and 3.

The only saving grace was Pam Bintliff as she was polite to talk to, but came to find out she is super dishonest and not professional at all. We had reserved a room block for my wedding and she let me know that post our 25 room block that every single other room in the whole hotel was taken, I asked if she had any recommendations for other hotels in the area and her tune completely changed. Suddenly, there were more rooms, and suddenly they would be able to supply us with a larger room block. These conversations happened within an hour of eachother.

On the day of our wedding, my husband called the front desk as we were instructed to get a few early check-ins. We did not request any specific floors, so with a 2-3pm checkin, I was hoping some out of towners could get there around 1pm. The front desk woman was extremely rude to my husband and said it absolutely could not be done and they needed to stick to that original check-in time. We came to find out that guests checked in early anyway, which proves that that individual did not even look into what he was requesting.

When we toured the hotel, midsentence the woman behind the counter TOOK OUT A SLIM JIM and just started going to town. Chewing and eating and talking to me with her mouth full.

Lastly, my mother who is from out of town had to stay about 4 nights to help with pre-wedding things. She was double charged and had to call Pam about removing one of the charges. So basically, if you do HAVE to stay here, make sure to check your CC statement, and definitely don't give them anything that connects to your bank, as god only knows what would happen.",2017-05-23 20:58:36

We booked a two bed junior suit, the sleeping area was separate from the common area. Around 12:30 at night, the buildings smoke alarm went off. EVERYONE in the building evacuated and 3 fire trucks and an ambulance came. We stood outside for 2 1/2 hours IN THE RAIN while the fire department put out the fire. Everyone kept asking hotel staff what was going on and no one could give us answers. We weren't able to reenter the building until a little after 2. ( Luckily we weren't like most guests and arrived by shuttle from the airport and we had a car to sleep in) so we slept in the car until we woke up after 2AM to find everyone that was outside back in the building. The next morning, long and behold the fire was the fault of the hotel. Their boiler caught fire. Which is probably why they didn't want to provide us with information about what was happening while we were standing in the rain. The general manager was rude. We were very upset that no one gave us information and felt that they were withholding information about the fire because it was their fault.

We places the card on file and checked in with Sonya. She handed us the key and some cookies and we went up to our room. Simple right? No. The next day we got a letter stating there was a problem with the card. We didn't understand so we called they then mentioned an additional 45$ a night in incidentals. So I placed another credit card on file. They took about 150$ off my second credit card and the full 520$ off my first card. I asked for a print out and they told me they couldn't give me one that would depict all charges until we checked out. Catisha was the second person we dealt with. The next day I tried swiping my credit card at a coffee shop and it declined. I called my card company and they said DoubleTree tried to process three additional payments that were pending for roughly 2000$. Mind you they've already taken 520 plus 150. Now they tried to process 2,000$. I was shocked. I called the front desk and Sibora immediately told me they were wrong. They didn't try to process anything my card company may have made a mistake. I peeked over the desk and saw all hose charged on their computer. They assured me they would take care of it. The next day was our anniversary and I received a Christmas bonus from work which I was going to use to surprise my fiancé and take him out to his favorite restaurant in Philadelphia. As were getting ready something told me to login and check my account and in my account was 3.50 where there should've been about $500. I was again shocked I pulled up a statement and I looked and Doubletree took an additional $400. I called the front desk after speaking with Sibora the previous day and she is assured me that they would not be taking any more money and all of the money would be refunded to me and I asked to speak to someone higher than her and she connected me to Linda Glover in accounting. Linda asked for my credit card information and three wayed  my credit card company and explain to them what was the issue and my credit card company explain to Linda that Doubletree was the one making all of these charges Linda claims that my credit card was charging me. After the runaround my fiancé got on the phone to speak with Linda and let her know that he felt like the stay should've been compensated because of this mistake we were not able to leave our rooms were not able to do anything because all of our money was tied up at the hotel. Linda told him that I should've been more responsible with my card and use it to pay bills instead of using American Express to pay for hotels. So rude and so unprofessional. We asked to speak to managers and they give us the runaround refuse to give us numbers. Long story short, today is January 3 and I'm still waiting for all of my money to be refunded they refuse to compensate to stay and in the end charged triple of what the hotel originally cost. DO NOT STAY HERE. THEY WILL OVERCHARGE YOU. Also elevators don't work. Only one and it's at least a 10 minute wait.",2016-01-03 21:41:19

 We check into the Hampton Inn on January 8th for a three night stay. Everything was fine, check in went smooth I was actually really liking the hotel. We paid in cash and put a credit card on file for damages. After the first night we noticed a blue tint on one side of the fitted sheet on our bed, but we thought nothing of it because it just looked like a set in stain they weren't able to remove. Considering this isn't the nicest hotel I thought it was probably common. We checked out and were good for a couple of days until we saw a $215 charge on our account. I called on 1/15 to find out what the charges were and they told me it was from ruining the linens in our room. The ""Manager on duty"" Arturo was a complete asshole basically accusing me of getting some unknown black substance all over the sheets, pillow cases, and duvet. Then when I asked for a manager after he told me there was nothing he could do he informed me he was the manager and that I could leave a voicemail for the GM Joaquin. I did and did not receive a call back in the morning like I was promised, so I took it upon myself to get in touch with him since I would have never received a call. When he got on the line he basically refused to listen to any other side of the story, he just kept saying there was nothing he could do and that the linens in our room were brand new when we checked in. One look at the sheets would have convinced you 100 people had used those linens prior to our arrival. He told us that they had taken pictures of the linens, but when we asked to see them he completely changed his story and said that if they still had the sheets he could take a picture. He also said he was standing right next to the manager when he took my call the day before. If that was the case he should have never let Arturo talk to me as rude as he did. He was full of shit throughout the whole conversation and his whole story was rather sketchy. He even had the audacity to tell me that they would use the sheets as rags. Are you kidding me? It must have been a slow week for this hotel. If you're willing to pay more for their shitty bed sheets than your whole hotel stay then I guess this is the hotel for you.

Hotel in Tucson, located at 750 Starr Pass, Tucson, AZ. which was booked through hotels.com.  The room we were assigned (#220) was unacceptable, unclean, in disrepair and, frankly
dangerous.  Sheetrock actually fell from the ceiling during our stay.  I have pictures that do not convey the decrepit shape of this room.  When we
complained and asked for another room, we were told they were full.  When
we asked for an adjustment on our bill, one person told us our stay would
be complimentary, until she was later over-ruled by the manager Tammy.  The
manager was rude and totally unresponsive.  We left early as a result of
this experience.  Tammy, the manager also promised to repair the room while we were away and when we returned at 3, the room was not repaired or even cleaned.  While ultimately an adjustment was made, NO amount of
money was reasonable for this room.  The website photos for this hotel
were not representative of its condition generally or our room
specifically.  The rating and quality of hotel was grossly misrepresented.
We will never stay at a Clarion again.  This experience ruined our
vacation.  I travel a great deal, as do my sisters, we have never
experienced a facility in this condition and also never experienced

This Hotel was the worst ever!!! The staff were so uneducated, rude, manipulative weasels , impolite, racist, cunning.... our check in staff was a sweet young lady and very friendly, that's the only staff member that I think should keep their job, the rest are trash employees. The general manager let me tell you, little ""Joaquin Duran"", was rude and unwelcoming, I don't know how he has a job as a general manger?  Little Luis/ the kid who is an immature staff shouldn't be working at a hotel where he acts all sweet in front of customers faces and then he switches 180% when confronted by his staff in front of customers. The first night we stayed at this hotel we were in the lobby socializing, when the little guy/general manager walks in the lobby and says the lobby is closed and you guys need to go to your rooms and keep it down because there are other guests here! This was at 10pm, Really??? What? Where does he think he is working? Or who does he think he is to send his hotel guests to their rooms?? When asked why? He said we are not listening to him and being rude to him, and are harassing his employees! So we all had to leave and go to our room. He called the cops on us reporting it as a drunken riot. First of all no one from our party was drinking, there were two ladies sitting and socializing with their kids and having some wine. The cops showed up and talked with us outside they laughed at the situation not being what it was and left. 
Long story short, JOAQUIN , said he's not going to let us stay at the hotel because we weren't listening to him. He thought we were with the party who had came and confronted his employee about their room, which they had paid for and wasn't ready at check in. He's kid employee had laughed at the family when they asked for their money back so they can go elsewhere, and the lady had said I'm not stupid why would you laugh at me?  Luis the kid twisted his story and informs his GM that they are harassing him. Really??? GM thinks we are in their party and tells us we are disrespecting his employees. First of all, prejudice little child GM why would you assume we are in the same party? Why would you call the cops with false accusations? This is going to go to corporate office ASAP. 
So the second night, again what's a lobby for? If not to socialize? Again we were sitting with our group, and here comes Luis/the child and tells us we have to leave the lobby, GM said that yesterday and he isn't going to be happy if I don't listen to him. We said okay got our stuff cleaned up and went outside to get few of our group members so we can leave and go to our rooms. There he is again coming outside with the phone and told us, Joaquin is watching you guys all outside and we need to go to our rooms or he is going to call the cops on us again. Okay really??? So we left and sure enough he called and cops showed up, same cop from the night before, laughed again and said as long as everyone is okay we weren't drunk and disruptive at all he saw and knew it was a wrong call from their need again and left. However, our only our group leader agreed when cops were over that he can leave if that's what GM wants and for us to stay since they think we were being disruptive. So here it is at 12:30 kids are sleeping everyone is in bed and we get a phone call saying that we should've left with our party and had vacated the rooms by now. Are you serious, no one told us to leave, our group leader agreed to leave and us to stay since we had kids. Again we listened and packed our bags and got rooms in another hotel middle of the night with kids and left. 
What an adventure. I am going to make sure corporate office fires these immature kids and we were not the only ones with issues. Others had as well. We talked to guests who had checked in gone out for a bit and came back to see that their room had other guests in there? Is this possible?

A restaurant and bar on site, a little ""general store"" for snacks and various items near the front desk, etc.  But I also feel like it's a bit of a mad house.  The staff is kind enough.   But overall my experience was lacking. 

Starting with room service.  WAY too expensive.  These days with food delivery services like Grubhub, I don't know why people would subject themselves to being ripped off by a place they're already paying quite a bit of money to stay at.  Also, for the cost of staying there, you think you'd get a free breakfast out of the deal.  You'd be wrong.  If you're a Hilton Honors member maybe.  Regular folk aren't so lucky.  It seems like a lot of the nicer things about this place are only nice the more you pay.  After you pay for your room, their goal seems to be milking as much more money out of you as they can.  And it's so blatantly obvious it's almost offensive.  

To top it all off, the staff seems to work at odd times of day.  I spent a good 45 mins with maid staff right outside my room making all kinds of noise.  Don't know what that was about.  Not to mention that no one seems to have a problem with kids running around screaming day AND night.

Obviously that is very misleading. This is not a typical doubletree by Hilton. Im a Hilton rewards member and travel often for work so Ive stayed in a lot of them. This looks like a motor lodge, ran like one too. Where do I start? First impression: homeless living at the back of  the parking lot just over the chain link fence. Theres a drainage ditch that has a large homeless city in it. We could see them and hear them while we were unloading our car. Super safe. And what a view out your window! Next. Our bathroom shower was gross. Had rust stains and mildew (see pics) and a large crack in the tub. Not inviting at all. The room itself was clean but this place needs a renovation badly. 
Only one of us got hot water in the shower. The other shower was lukewarm even after waiting 30 minutes between showers. Called the front desk and asked why there was no hot water and the guy said he would check on it and call us back. Never did. So my daughter skipped a shower and thats not ok after a 13 hour drive . How does a hotel not have enough hot water for 2 SHOWERS? Explain that to me?  Does this place have any management whatsoever? At 4am we were awoken by loud conversations outside. My husband got up to get something out of the car and there were guest (?) standing outside cussing and carrying on and a car pulled up. They exchanged something and were being very loud with the person in the car. I called the front desk and the woman named Godman answered. I asked if they have security in this place and she said they did but they had just left. I told her the situation and she very rudely yelled ""I'll call the police"" and hung up. She didn't want to be bothered obviously. With that we packed up and left. At 4:30am. We cut our night short to get the heck out of there. Not only is this place not safe, it's definitely not worth $140 for a room. This is a Motel 6 stay at best.

I don't know Maybe my family and I aren't considered ""high class"" enough to be treated with respect or even common courtesy but that should really be no way to conduct any hospitality business . They're literally being paid to just smile and greet people and they can't even do that. On many occasions I felt completely snuffed and ignored when simply asking a question, or trying to purchase extremely over priced items from the lobby shop. On the first night we stayed here, my fiancé didn't know the room number and didn't have his phone to call or text me and he asked the front desk if they could help, he gave my name and the full name of my father whom all of the rooms were under and the girl refused to give a room number or to even just call the room for him. Some what understandable for security purpose but they should have handled it differently or at least tried to call one of the 4 rooms we had. We also had to switch rooms from 218 to 429 because there was a leak in the ceiling, very inconvenient but no fault of the hotel staff I guess  .. Another instance of just pure inconsiderate behavior would be tonight the reason I'm writing this lengthy review, when Chelsea one of the girls working at the front desk called my room at 10pm, while my son and nephew are asleep because they have school in the morning, to tell me there is no credit card on file to pay for a phone call made from my room a week ago during a time when I was in the first room(the leaky ceiling one). I told her I didn't know what she was talking about and she said she'll remove it for now, so I went downstairs with my father to clear it up completely and when I went downstairs I asked the girl at the computer if she was Chelsea , she barely even looked up and quickly replied ""sure not!"" And said nothing else , while still just staring at the computer screen. Which in my opinion was very rude, so I turned to the other person at the desk and he went in the back and got her for us . When she came out I asked again when the charge was to make sure we hadn't done it and she told me , then she said she removed the charge anyway, so that was fine but she couldn't have even apologized for calling so late or for making the mistake in the first place ? I'm just very glad to be leaving this place as tonight is our last night here , So I thought I'd shed some light on how they treat their guests .

They sounded like a really grumpy old couple who doesn't like someone next to them having FUN late at night.

It seems they cater to large groups/parties and have forgotten about the individual traveler. Some people near our room were really noisy at midnight and sounded like they were having a party. I called the front desk at 12am to complain and the gentleman who answered the phone said that he would take care of it. I still heard noise at 12:15am, so I called the front desk again and he said that he told them to be quiet. The noise did die down after that and I was able to go back to sleep. The next morning, my husband called the front desk and talked to Christian/Kristen (sp?) about the noise during the previous night and she was not sympathetic or professional at all. She accused us over the phone that we were the ones that knocked on the door of the noisy room at 9pm, which we were not, and we said no. After our phone conversation and having breakfast, we decided to go to the front desk and talk to Christian to tell her our side of the story and get a discount because we did not get a good nights rest. When we asked for the discount, Christian flat out said ""No"", without really giving us a chance or without really listening to us and our side of the story.  She said that from what she heard from Joaquin, who was supposedly working that night, that it was us that knocked on the door of the noisy people's room at 9pm and that it was us that were making the noise. We were shocked by this information and were very upset by these accusations. How could she even accuse us of those things when she was not even there or relay hearsay from Joaquin who was not present at the time of our conversation?  That was just unprofessional. Christian could have just said that she will discuss it with Joaquin and they would both get back to us instead of immediately pointing fingers and asking accusatory questions insinuating that it was our fault. When we tried to tell her our side of the story, she kept on saying what she had heard and that she had to hear from Joaquin to get his side of the story. Of course Joaquin was not there during our discussion to clarify what he said and that he had the day off. She didn't try to reach him over the phone to confirm what she heard was true. We vehemently said repeatedly to her that we were NOT the ones that knocked on the noisy room's door at 9pm - we didn't even know which room the noise was coming from, so how could we knock on their door? We also vehemently said that we were NOT the ones that made the noise. How could she relay this information and be accusatory to us without Joaquin being there or having absolutely no proof of anything she heard. I did not notice the noise coming from the other room until around midnight - their loud laughing and talking woke me up. We are also respectful hotel guests and wouldn't just go knock on someone's door. We also do not make noise during our stay, so how could these actions be coming from us. The fact though when Christian said that someone knocked on the noisy room's door at 9pm just showed us that we were not the only ones who were bothered by the ruckus the people in that room were making and that other hotel guests were affected too. Even if someone knocked on the noisy room's door was before the noise curfew, the fact that the people in the room knew they were making noise just by someone knocking on their door and didn't stop until midnight just showed the hotel's lack of handling the situation in a professional way. We felt that this whole situation was handled unprofessionally. The fact that they were accusing us of things we did NOT do and they have no evidence of just showed me that it was a deflection of their incompetence to handle the matter in a professional way. In fact, because of how this was handled we did not stay overnight on our last day there. We checked out early and moved to stay overnight at Silver Legacy, which was 1000x better than this place. We did not even come back the next day to talk to Joaquin so that he could hear our side of the story in order to pursue our discount and complain about the way the whole situation was handled because we felt it would have been a waste of our time. After reading other recent negative Yelp reviews of this place and dealing with the management, we felt we made the right decision not to come back because it confirmed it would have been pointless. We just took it as a lesson learned not to stay in this hotel ever again and they have lost good customers.",2020-09-11 18:18:07
EXzrttol6wVozuqC8Op84Q,nFEcGBBEEZzwE46kqi6Xvw,THeEPb1SgJLhwMlWrxOeSQ,1,0,0,0,"By far one of my worst stays at a hotel... I booked a reservation a couple days before and asked for adjoining rooms. During my reservation making I informed the rep that I would be coming to the hotel with my 12-year-old son and six of his cousins because it is my sons birthday and he wanted to go swimming. When I got to the hotel to do the check in, there was a convention going on and I was told by Ryan that I could not get an adjoining room and that the hotel has been booked for two days. But that the rooms were two rooms apart. But when Ryan gave me the key card the rooms were 505 and 511. So I said to Ryan these rooms are not two rooms apart, they are 5 to 6 rooms apart. I informed Ryan that the whole purpose of me making reservations and requesting two rooms connected  is because my 12-year-old son and his friends wanted to go swimming. Ryan informed me that this is not a party hotel and I asked him why wasn't that explain during the reservation making process. Ryan rudely told me that he could cancel the reservation and I explained to him that that was impossible because I had already planned everything.  So because I was not happy you're going to put me out of a hotel that I paid my hard earned money for!?!?  I proceeded to walk away from Ryan towards the elevators and go to my room Ryan in turn yelled at me and came up from behind the counter and told me that ""he was talking to me."" I responded with your not talking to me like that first of all you told me that I can get rooms adjoining and now you're telling me I can't get it and you're being rude can I speak to a manager.  Ryan told me ""No"" he was the manager.   He then proceeded to come from around the counter in a threatening manner like he was going to do something to me.  I walked away went upstairs to check on the rooms it when I came back downstairs to go to my car Ryan stopped me and apologized for his outburst and his action.  I said to him maybe you're under a lot of pressure he said yes but I'm thinking I'm a guest I have nothing to do with your pressure or stress level.   I was so annoyed  y his behavior I told him that I will be Yelping  him.  Later on that evening my son and his cousins down to the pool but we got to the pool supervisor Manny came in and advised us that everyone under 18 pass to get out of the pool.  I say wow this everybody in the pool OK no problem I told my nephews and my son to come out of the pool I have two nephews that were over 18 so I told them to stay.  Manny turn to my nephew and asked  how old he was my nephew he replied with 18 Manny then proceeded to question my nephew even more I explain to Manny that he didn't have to do that he didn't have to regulate my nephew I told him to get out of the pool and I will be taking him upstairs to the room.  He told me in an Extremely sarcastic way he was just doing his job that he does not make the rules. Then he proceeded to argue with me about kids in the pool, after I had already told the kids to get out. I told him I didn't like his tone and I would be  reporting him to corporate. He sarcastically asked me if I need a corporate's phone number I told him no I'm able to find it on my own.  I left the pool area with my nephews and we headed back up to our room for the rest of the night.  Around 10 o'clock I heard a knock at the door and it was Manny again this time telling me that the kid was running up the hall.  I said that's impossible but the kid has to walk down the hall because you guys did not give us adjoining rooms that we ask for in the beginning.  By now I was fed up with the treatment and rudeness of staff.  I called corporate and file the complaint and was offered 2000 points so bored hey stay for another time. I am form corporate but I didn't want any points because I would not be back at the establishment the treatment was horrible.  First I was holiday in front of other guests by the manager Ryan then I would talk to like I was trash by the supervisor Manny.  My claim number is 201804222167 I spoke with Tim and corporate on 4/21/18.  Needless to say I will not be returning to this hotel and I'm waiting on corporate to contact me so we can have a resolution to the issue.",2018-04-23 17:56:52

We had to call the front desk easily 4 or more times until the maintenance man finally showed up to fix out toilet that had clogged out of no where. Then after he snakes it for like 5 min he tells us he has to go get a bigger better tool and doesn't come back for 45 min and he comes back with the same tool he had before!!! While he was snaking it for the 2nd time the maid came in and started cleaning our room! I left my mom at the room while I ran an errand and when I came back the bathroom smelled like human poop super bad and I couldn't figure out what it was, then I notice a bag with brown looking stuff in it in the bathroom door way and sure enough it had human feces in it... ALOT!!! I didnt get any sort of 1 night refund or anything just a ""sorry""! That bag of poop sat in our bathroom for about 24 hrs and all they did was say sorry!

cVbQ3dxBAntg19tjNXvbYA,_TtMZqkRuGWBZeAPk0_qhg,kbAvGWufNK6sgub3EdiKhA,1,4,0,0,"Where to start with this review. We arrived to check in around 5:30ish with family in tow that had picked us up from the airport. We were going to drop off our luggage and then go have dinner with them. Upon arrival to our room, there was a disheveled blackout curtain laying on one of the beds with some of the attachment casters underneath it. I called the front desk as politely as I could knowing I was going to need the darkness from that curtain in a few hours after returning and being exhausted. The girl at the front desk said she would come pick it up. Now.... you would Think that she would also have maintenance fix the curtain (as we need it to not have glaring sun in our faces as we tried to sleep after traveling all day). NOPE. When we got back from the family adventures (exhausted) low and behold there was no curtain. Dismayed and a little frustrated, we called the front desk at 11pm and said - there is no curtain, can you please get someone to come install it. She said no, maintenance leaves at 5pm and I can't fix the curtain myself.  You can imaging how frustrating this was for us. They checked us into a room that was clearly not ready for us to check into. I asked who the manager was, she said there was no manager - which was not true because we met him the next day. So, eager to get sleep we asked the girl to come bring us the broken curtain and we would fix it ourselves, which we did. We stood on the chair in the room at 11pm at night and stood on a very wobbly chair being very very tired, and we, the hotel guests paying $200+ per night fixed the curtain ourselves (as best as we could anyway). 

To make matters worse, we couldn't use the air or heat the entire stay as the heater released fumes that smelled horribly when you turned it on. PLUS, the coffee pot was broken shards on the pouring area. 

The next day, we were eager to see what they had intended to do to fix the room. We went up to a young man at the front desk and told him our story. Obviously we were a bit unhappy. 

He came at us saying he could do nothing to help us and maybe we should move hotels (as in leave the establishment and go somewhere else) as we were not satisfied. He also said he couldn't do anything because we booked through Expedia. This review is getting long so I will cut to the chase - this person who did not know how to manage ended up being the hotel manager (that we were originally told didn't exist and had seemed to have NO idea what happened to us the night before).

Bottom line, we were treated so rudely and should not have been checked in to a room that was not ready for visitors. For $200 per night, I suggest you find an establishment that treats its customers right.

We ended up calling Expedia and they ended up brokering a credit for one night for us. Unfortunately, the employees and maintenance at this establishment don't really seem to understand the hospitality industry.",2017-09-10 22:05:02

The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the lack of any welcoming into the hotel. The staff was cold and curt and did not make me feel appreciative for my business. When I later called them to make requests they were even more rude. Not too sure what I did wrong, but clearly I was not welcome here even though I am a Marriott Bonvoy member, and a loyal one at that.

I also did not like the layout of the room, and the bed itself. The bathroom sinks are literally outside of the bathroom, and the showers have only a half glass door. Basically they want me to live and step in my own bath water, how disgusting. The bed was also incredibly uncomfortable and the room gets uncomfortably hot at inopportune times.

I hated going up to the front office for many different reasons, the first and biggest reason was the manager Dora Perez.  I have never incountered someone sooooo ruxe in my life. She is very disrespectful and seems to hate life all around, she never smiles and does not listen to any of the customers. Was 10 mins  late one day on a payment due to the fact that i work nights  and when i went up there to get my keys reconfigured this miserable life of a human being gave me a very rude remark/tone and then proceeded to tell me i better not ever let it happen again or she will kick me out after i apologized i said  she didnt have to be so rude to me it was an honest mistake she said you know what you need to get your stuff and leave right now. While packing up my stuff she continues calling the room phone and harassing me. So i quit answering the phone and after three times of calling back to back i answer again and she says she has the police on the way to get me out( mind you i was already packing up to leave). On my way out i asked for corporate or a higher up and she would not give me corporates phone number or let me speak to anyone else. She is anything but friendly. If you want to have a terrible trip, be streesed out and be spoken poorly to make sure you book a room here. Dora will have no prob being a bitch to you and definitely have no prob harassing you.  Can almost guarantee you if you arrive around 3-6 you will walk in on an unsatisfied customer and hear them complaining about her over charging them. The week i stayed there someone was literally in the office trying to get something taken care of as far as billing or being over charged at least 5 out of the 7 days.  Dora would always give some kind of lie to them saying there was nothing she could do. And after they would leave she would start talking bad about the person and laughing at them saying they are ""clowns"": or ""so stupid"" Who ever hired this lady made a major mistake bc they have and will continue to lose a ton of business as long as she is there She doesn't care about losing the money or how the customer feels bc it doesn't come out of her pocket.

She became irate and upset then said why would I contest her rate. Which makes no sense because I've done this countless times, including at this location. As a business you shouldn't push customers away and get upset for having to do your job. Hotel is overpriced, if you're going to up charge at least make sure the customer service is A1.

Starting with the doors, they appear to have not been cleaned since the 1980s. Even the do not disturb sign was filthy & worn! To a germaphobe like myself, this was disgusting & unacceptable 

The room itself is constructed with the cheapest of pressed wood furniture. It's old & beat up as well. They provide you one closet that fits barely a few items & the drawers of the dresser hadn't been cleaned for decades as well. Suffice to say I hung whatever was wrapped in plastic in the closet & left the rest in my bags. 

The bathrooms are atrocious. I myself chose to cover the entire floor with towels to cover the almost offensively white builders grade tile & the cracks in them as well. If you're like me & appreciate a shower, well, this isn't the place for you! Think Home Depot basics with a handicap bar that has turned a whole new color typically not going in the spectrum. 

The grounds & general property were ok. There's a boardwalk of sorts behind the hotel which was kind of cool & mellow. The room service took forever & the good was horrid! (Mess up a cheesesteak in philly?!! ) 

Everywhere I looked online this hotel was given 4 stars! Either I'm extremely particular or the rest of the traveling community is blind! 

Bottom line is this hotel gets 1 star & that's only because I didn't get a room with bed bugs ...shocking actually. 

If you can afford the extra $100 + or - I'd strongly advise you stay at the Four Seasons ! If you've got some bucks then make sure you get the suite facing the fountain!

My check in experience was pleasant. The staff was warm and helpful. They gave me great directions to a few local places and I always appreciate local insider suggestions. 

The room was clean and spacious. The couch and bed were comfortable and I had a great city view. 

Monday- Wednesday they offer an evening mixer on the 2nd floor. The appetizers are ample and 1 complimentary alcoholic beverage is provided as well. Breakfast is served in the same area daily. 

The location is superb. A grocery store is walking distance if you want to take advantage of the kitchenette. Otherwise, there are dozens of choices within a few blocks of the front door. 

Now, the valet...I didn't park here my first night. I'd already parked at a lot near a restaurant not far from the hotel and decided to leave the car there overnight and walk through the city instead. My second night, i pulled up to the valet area and lots of vehicles were already there. Seeing that it was busy, i expected to wait and had no problem with it. After about 7 minutes, the valet approached and asked if i was checking in. I said no. He responded by asking what am I trying to do. I respond that I'd like to park in valet. He repeats ""so you're checking in"" to which i again say no. He's rude and clearly irritated with me. He sighs and says ok, look, i have these 2 cars that need to be parked and a construction vehicle because they're doing work tonight and they're all ahead of you. I said, ok, what should i do? Should i come back or try to park elsewhere. I'm just trying to get to my room, so I'm ok either way. He tells me to wait here and walks off. 

Less than a minute later, a woman approaches my passenger side screaming. I let the window down and she continues screaming at me to move my car. I told her that valet just told me to wait here and he'd be back. She said ""I'm valet and I'm telling you to move now!"" Confused, i look around and see what my options are. There are cars in front of me and to my right. Traffic is on my left, so i can't immediately move. I scoot up a bit to show a good faith effort, but really have nowhere to go. Another minute later, the car in front of me moves and the male valet returns and says that he'll put my car somewhere. I asked was he going to park it or just put it somewhere. He said he needs to figure out where he can put it so it'll be a bit. I reply that i can park elsewhere if valet is full. He cuts me off and tells me that he'll take care of it. I say that I'll just go try to park at another place. He pulls out the valet tickets and tells me he'll give me a ticket and that i can't park anywhere else. I ask if other hotels are open for parking. He repeats that i have to park with him. I know this isn't true because i self parked 4 blocks away the night before. He continued to tell me in an aggressive manner that i had to park with him. I said that I'll just try to park on my own and before i could finish the sentence he slammed my door and walked off.

WRONG! GM KENJA of this Hampton Inn has absolute no regard for customers or providing well customer service. To a great level I am astounded on how she holds a general manager position for a Hilton hotel with such low standards of customer service. How can someone with such lack of such service, manage a hotel, or any hotel that requires you to be a LEADER in demonstrating a high regard for customer service.? Kenja does not care for your stay nor your comfort and above all for your charges. The card was authorized for 3 nights plus room and tax and what not. AFTER she cancelled ALL my pre-existing reservations. SHE WENT AHEAD AND AUTHORIZED MY CARD A SECOND TIME FOR ANOTHER WITHOUT GIVEN CONSENT!! I was asked to go talk to the manager cause I had ""booked again"" but I hadn't booked after nor tried after such UNPLEASANT interaction with KENJA. All-in-all I am glad I found another hotel where I am treated as a human and my business is appreciated and they are concerned unlike Kenja. This encounter was so sour and so out of place for a HOSPITALITY industry general manager to act in such manner and have such low demeanor. HILTON CAN DO WAY BETTER THAN THAT. I will next go directly to Hilton of such experience and explain exactly the trajectory of this encounter and of the circumstance behind such horrible bind. Additionally, Kenja dared to call early to my room and call me a liar. Is this the bar that Hilton has now set for their general managers? Have they gone so downhill that they don't care that the general manager is calling up to a person's room and calling them a liar? As a business owner I would be afraid to hire someone like Kenja. Why? Because someone like her with such disregard to her role is a liability to a business and opens doors for suits for harassment by operating in such way while representing the Hilton company. The last thing as a business owner that anyone would want is the carelessness and lack of attention of a general manager who now becomes a liability.

The girl at the front desk answered right away. She does not answer if the call is coming from one of the rooms. I told her about the refrigerator and the toilet. I asked for the refrigerator to be cleaned, the toilet to be fixed, and extra towels and wash clothes. An older man and woman came to the room. The woman was holding a toilet brush and had the towels/wash clothes on top of it. The toilet brush was used and I refused to accept the towels and wash clothes. I have no idea why she brought the toilet bowl brush anyway. We needed the toilet fixed, not cleaned. The man and woman did not speak English, so it was hard to communicate with them. The man waited outside the door and the woman came inside and cleaned the water off the bathroom floor which did not fix the issue. She didn't clean the refrigerator! They left and a different man came with new towels/wash clothes. I explained to him that the toilet was still leaking. He called the maintenance employee and told him of the issue. We left the motel for a while, came back and the toilet was still leaking! The room also has flies and at night the roaches come out! I'm truly disgusted! I can't sleep, because I'm afraid something will crawl on me. I booked two rooms when I called and was told the rooms would have a microwave and refrigerator. My room only has a refrigerator and my mom's room has neither! Also, people live at the motel. They sit outside of their rooms and kids play in the parking lot. It's truly ghetto. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!

Update: I Googled Econo Lodge corporate office and called the 1800 number listed. This location is independently owned under Choice Hotels. I filed a formal complaint against this location due to the poor state of the rooms and customer service. I plan to call the health department as well. I was moved to a different room. I requested a room that has a microwave and refrigerator. The unprofessional woman at the front desk said ""None of the rooms have microwaves."" I got to the room and there was a microwave in the room! By the way the microwave was disgusting. The handles on the drawers are broken too and there's flies in the new room as well.

Final update: The second room had roaches as well. Room service isn't offered. My mom ran out of toilet tissue and went to the front desk to get more. The woman got an attitude and told her she had to wait on the housekeeper, but the housekeeper only comes in to clean a room when someone checks out which is not often, because the motel operates like an apartment complex. Bags of trash is left outside of rooms for days at a time, which is probably why they have roaches. I filed a complaint with the health department in Delaware county (610) 521-3530, ext 103.

HUGE DIFFERENCE! 

Front desk treated us like drifters that were looking to skip out on the bill. Used a Visa to secure & pay for reservation OR SO I THOUGHT! Checked in at 1:30a after a 7 hr flight, the antiquated cc machine would not accept my Visa card despite Hilton confirming & reassuring (on multiple times prior to trip) that my room/reservation was paid for and secure. 

Durand at FD couldn't be bothered from night audit to help or give any service just stood and did his paperwork. He couldn't even be bothered to give the ""standard check-in script"" (breakfast, water bottles, location of room or even room #...nothing). Barely spoke. 

At 2:15a, frustrated & exhausted, I finally got into my room. 

7am Rebecca( FD Mgr) is calling me to kick me & my son out. Went down to FD w CC to run it again with hope of empathy and better customer service. WRONG! I even called Visa on speaker to verify funds in front of her and she still rejected my card. She then FOLLOWED me upstairs & FOLLOWED me into my room w/o permission like I was shoplifting! (I used to work in hospitality and know this is a CARDINAL SIN!)

She woke my son up but stood arms-crossed in my room waiting to ""watch me/us pack"". 

I used a different card to pay in full and even then Rebecca offered ZERO apologies for her dramatic intrusive and flat out rude actions and downright cruddy customer service. She did nothing. 

If this trip wasn't a Christmas present to my son, I would've punched Rebecca out- Rocky Style. 

She just didn't/doesn't care and stared at me nodding while I voiced my complaints, like I used to do when I tuned my mother out. The front desk sucks at service all around and are so rude.

There was a problem with the water and it was shut off for a portion of the day-they were repairing the pipes or something.

Only downside is not the fault of the hotel, but the walls are ridiculously thin and after the bars closed my fiance and I were rudely awakened by our neighbors.

Hotel- Like I said, It's exterior is very nice. Modern with a slight twist of bed rock in the front lawn area. Glass centered elevator reminded me of being back in Downtown LA  again. Front desk lady was nice and helpful. It was 105 last weekend when we drove in and she saw and gave us water immediately. Did we look like crap, or just being nice? Probably just being nice. 

Room- Clean and good sized. I paid 125 for it with 2 beds for my brother and I. Quiet place with the doors on the inside, clean carpeting, looking good. Bed was nice as were the pillows, big and fluffy, my favorite, with no void in the middle of the bed. For the price I was thinking it should've had a refridge and micro in though. Bathroom was clean, One thing, It had no fan in the bathroom, so when we showered it turned into the freakin' Rainforrest in there after 5 minutes, weaksauce. 

Amenities-2 bottles of water that were in the room were 10 bux??? Dang, those should be free, am I in Beverly hills again? Darn GPS. Went to the bar for a pre dinner drink with my cousin who lives in Tucson, and the bartender/server was very rude to us. We tried to make small talk about the happenings of the city for the night and she totally dismissed us, we weren't rude or anything, and my cousin had to ask someone else to get his beer!! Strike 1. Here comes strike 2. The next morning we went downstairs to partake in their restaurant, seriously, some of the worst food I had all weekend. It was 30 bucks for the 2 of us, ouch, for breakfast. The potatoes were really sour. We mentioned to the server and got hashbrowns instead. She also brought me out brunt toast, this was funny because when I looked at the toast, she immediately asked if i wanted some new ones, If she knew this, why would she bring them out to me in the first place???? It took longer to get new un-burnt toast than the new hasbrowns, go figure. The restaurant has some problems. Don't bother, over priced Denny's food.",2012-05-01 18:19:37

It was also annoying that only one light switch controlled like every light in the place other than the interior bathroom.)

The worst thing was some of the blatantly racist staff. I showed up early one Sunday for the continental breakfast, where there were 4 or 5 other people eating, and was asked for my room key. I asked why and they said that it was to ensure that I was a guest. I have been to about 30 of these tiny free continental breakfasts at hotels in my lifetime, but this was a first.

First of all, I booked this resort with a friend  to celebrate an occasion.  I was looking for a romantic evening. I am pretty easy-going and am rarely offended by anyone. Unfortunately, I knew something was up when I waited half and hour to check in and then the receptionist was very rude to me.  

Second, we made it into our room around 8:00pm and there was an extremely loud party on the patio that overlooks all of the posada-style rooms. It was unacceptable at 8:00pm, and it was unacceptable over 4 hours later when it was still going on.  At that point, what am I supposed to do? Tell my friend to pack her things so we can argue with the receptionist? The walls of our room were vibrating from the noise. 

Third, we tried to enjoy the hot tub, which was fairly small and dirty. Well past 8:00pm, there were kids under 10 playing in it, and no one was around to enforce any rules.  In the morning when I was checking out the receptionist would not make any accommodations for my complaints.

First off, it took twenty (20) minutes from the time of our seating to the arrival of our cocktails.. Cocktails were terrible.  They were  obviously prepared with cheap bottled mixers rather than professionally mixed..  The tequila sunrise my wife ordered was  made with a weak almost imitation orange juice and my Bloody Mary with a flavor infused vodka, cheap BM mix, and astuffed  olive.  No tabasco, worcestershire etc.  .  To her credit, he waitress did comp the BM due to the slow delivery time. 

Skipping ahead to the dessert table.  It was pretty sparse and not high quality.  It consisted of 6 or 8 cakes and pies that looked and tasted like they came from the local Safeway.  Dry, unflavorful and presented  in the aluminum pie plates they came in.  UGH!  My wife requested a cup of coffee to end her meal.  It was brought out in a cup w/o saucer. , I've had coffee served in a mug w/o a sauce before r, usually in a diner or truck stop but not in a supposedly decent restaurant.  

This place needs to hire a  bartender and a pastry chef.   

My first inkling of a disaster on the  food service  line  was at the Fruit/salad station.  I immediately noticed a  large bowl of sliced, canned peaches right out front.  PLEASE!! at $60 a head you are going to offer me canned peaches.  

I cannot  comment on the breakfast items as I never eat those offerings at buffets.  I always head right for the good stuff like shell fish, the carving stations  etc.  The shrimp, gravlax and prime rib were very good.  The lamb, and pork loin were overdone and dry.

No complaints on the wait staff.  They were all pleasant, very courteous and accommodating.  However, the management saw fit to include a $25 gratuity on the bill.  If the diner did not carefully check his/her bill it was easily overlooked.  An unknowing guest  could easily include an additional tip on top of the one already determined by the management.

After seeing the dozens of fruit flies hovering over the coffee carafes and experience borderline-horrible customer service, I thought to myself ""oh geez, this hotel is going to suck.  My room is going to smell like urine, have filthy carpet, a gross tub and one of those itchy, flimsy blankets that smells like cigarettes and solicited sex.""

Much to my surprise, I was wrong!!  I got to my room and it was actually pretty decent.  It was clean, the tub wasn't gross at all (but I would still wear shower shoes!), the TV was updated and the bed was comfy with a nice down comforter and duvet.

What I didn't like about this hotel was Cory...  the woman at the front desk.  She was rude, inattentive and her uniform was disheveled and tacky looking.  While she was checking me in, she made no conversation.  She took my credit card and ID and swiped my card without notifying me of the $35 hold for incidentals.  I stay in hotels quite a bit, so I was aware of the charge...  however, she didn't know that I was aware of the charge, so she should have told me.  When she was done with my identification, she put my cards on the counter and shoved them towards me...  I handed my cards to her in her hand, so I expected the same courtesy in return.  As she was wrapping up, she received a phone call from someone (I'm assuming it was a coworker).  She activated my keys, gave them to me and continued to talk on the phone.  I stood there waiting for further instruction, a ""thank you"", a ""let me know if you need anything"", but I didn't get any of that.  What I did get, when she finally hung up the phone, was a ""now what do you want"" type of look.  I asked her if there was anything else and she said no...  so I asked her where the elevators were and she pointed behind her as if I was bothering her.

This was one of the worst hotel experiences of my life. We arrived and had a double bed, and I tried to nicely ask for King or Queen room. They turned us down, coming up with various excuses but clearly lying. :/ We booked on priceline so no biggie that we couldn't switch, but don't lie! They could have just said we got the cheap rate and that they couldn't give us a Queen or King. Instead they chose to lie - which was apparent because I got a different answer from the two people i spoke with, both of whom were very rude and seemed to think I was being very difficult for having a request.

But the worst part was that the room had a terrible odor. I reported it but they seemed to think I was a picky customer or something and kept telling me to come back when they were less busy, after 3, etc. Finally I discovered that one of the beds had not been properly cleaned and that there was vomit on it. I begged someone to come and look and a lobby attendant came. She was horrified, said no one should ever have to go through this. She asked me to call the front desk and explain that this was a serious issue and they'd need more than standard cleaning or I'd have to get a new room. They didn't seem to want to listen to me so finally the lobby attendant got on the phone. A manager arrived who asked why we didn't report it sooner (we tried!). It was our second day and I just couldn't take the smell anymore! Once I discovered the source of the smell (we were only using one of the beds, thankfully not the vomit one), I had to TELL THEM TO GET SOMEONE UP TO SEE THIS. Finally, the manager gave us keys to a new room and left, clearly disgusted (it was so gross!) but NEVER APOLOGIZING for our inconvenience.

The lobby attendant was the only nice, apologetic and helpful person in the entire hotel. She should run the place :). 

Oh, and they say they have free wi-fi but it didn't work the entire time. We were there for 2 days on a prime tourist weekend.

Room and whole Hallway reeks like smoke, the beds are as flat and a tabletop, so hard it hurts to lay down. With muscle issues am I suppose to sleep on this bed? Me, my husband and son ALL have muscular issues and now we have hard cardboard to sleep on so we all have pain and bad moods from the pain. The front desk agent had to call the ""on duty manager"" at home since he was off for the day and when she started talking about what is going on she started talking in Spanish so I can't understand. I told her I want to know what she is saying, she quickly hung up saying he will call back in a few minutes. He called back and she did it again. This hotel is full of incompetent employees. Had a different issue with the SAME ""front desk manager"" last week checking into the Quality Inn next door. They are rude, incompetent and just ignorant. 

Staff have been caught talking about patrons in Spanish when they walk away from the desk or area they are in. What type of staff do these places have? Let them think it is ok to talk about others in other languages? Even the ""front desk manager"" has been caught doing it. 

A kicker to the situation, the elevator works when it wants to. When you push for the 1st floor it takes you to the dark dingy basement. When you get down there and push the 1st floor button it takes you to the 4th floor. When brought to the front desk employees they laugh and say ""it works sometimes, use the stairs!."" Excuse me? I have 4 big heavy suitcases and on the 4th floor. Why would they NOT have them fixed? This is NOT suppose to be a cheap run down motel which it is coming across to being.

The hotel is undergoing renovations but we were not bothered by any of it during our stay. The room was surprisingly clean as the reviews from others had problems with cleanliness. Our family enjoyed hanging out in the lobby to stay out of the heat and it was really nice. 

The cons of this hotel was the murky pool. The kiddos were really looking forward to going for a swim and when we went to the front desk they said it was cleaned daily. I don't know what they cleaned it with but it was a weekend and the pool should be cleaned. Although it didn't stop some people from letting their kids go in.

We did feel for a minute like we were taking our lives in our hands driving through a pretty industrial area, but the hotel was a welcome sight. The parking lot is GIGANTIC and I cannot imagine why they have that much parking. I was seriously expecting a Target or a chain restaurant somewhere nearby. 

The front desk staff was extremely warm and welcoming. Our room on the 4th floor offered beautiful views of the water and nearby docks (if you ignored the gigantic plumes of pollution in the background) and there were a number of sports bars nearby that had ample parking. 

The breakfast on Saturday morning had a good selection although the fruit wasn't very appealing. It was the standard Holiday Inn free breakfast but was exactly what we needed before a day of drinking.

We did have one less-than-stellar experience. We asked for a cot for our room (granted, it was at like 11:30pm so that was our fault) and we were told the room is too small for a cot. I don't know if the fire codes in Philadelphia are super strict or what, but our room had 2 full beds and easily room for another one. A twin cot would have fit without a problem. Since we couldn't get a cot, we asked for extra blankets. It took about 2 hours and the blanket that was delivered was basically a beach towel. It was thin, offered no warmth, and was not very big at all. We were planning on making a bed on the floor for one of us to sleep on, and since all we were given was a tiny blanket we ended up sharing beds. Oh - and the alarm in our room went off at 6am on Saturday morning, as did the alarm in a neighboring room. I would think the housekeeping staff would double check to make sure no alarms are set if the room is turning over.

Otherwise, this was a great experience and I would definitely stay here again if I needed to be close to the airport or Navy Yard. It was an $8 or $9 Lyft (with 50% off) to get to the Navy Yard, which is definitely doable.",2017-10-23 14:59:03

Also when my mother called to talk to the manager about the verbal assault and the rude encounter, Brandy picked up again and started to YELL, SCREAM and RANT at my mother without giving my mother a chance to speak, and once again ""manager"" HUNG UP again. 

Not only that when we stayed at the hotel, the elevator was out of service, so we had to move our heavy luggage 3 floors by hand. And there are not enough parking space.

I would not recommend anyone to stay at this hotel unless they want horrible customer service. Even if they lower their price it is not worth it.",2017-06-29 17:51:22

PdSu3wt3V7oCD0DFH5xaFQ,C-rmuIMu0N1l60pJATjaWg,HDQyEpOqoowQyQzMoP_Jjw,3,0,1,0,"Well. Here I go. They could have easily received 3.5 or 4 stars BUT they forget about the little things that matter. I barely want to give 3 stars. 

Let's start with the pros:
Nice clean rooms, restaurant on site, good housekeeping staff, quiet at night, nice size TVs in rooms, comfortable bed, nice pool, beautiful fitness center, private parking, and great location -- near KOP Mall, restaurants, great stores like Wegmans, The Container Store, Crate & Barrel, and Pier 1. 

Cons: NO INTERNET ACCESS in your private room. You have to pay for access in your room on a daily basis ($9.00) OR inconveniently go to the lobby to use the hotel's computer or they will give you a code that can ONLY be used in the lobby. Remember, you're already paying between $70.00 and $170 per night! I've stayed at other Sheraton locations and this one is the first one that charges. Because of this reason, and the rude manager, I would have to seriously consider staying here again. I NEED the Internet and would rather not have to leave the comfort of my room nor pay and additional fee! I've stayed at the Sheraton JFK about 5 or 6 times...it is smaller but still nice. AND...there is NO ADDITIONAL FEE to use the Internet at the Sheraton JFK. 

Con 2: I was told that they would put a hold on my card for the amount of my stay...they DID NOT tell me that it would be an additional hold of $50.00 per night. This may not be much to others but it adds up for each night....but, I think that they should be clear and explain the details to be sure that the customer is clear. They did not explain it or show me anything. Next time I will ask for a detailed explanation and get it in writing (I take partial blame...a very small part)

Con 3: rude manager...I think her name something with a K. When I explained that they should be more clear about the charges she was very condescending and refused to take any of the blame....placing it all on the customer. I promise you that I was being very polite and despite her behavior I remained professional. 

The main issue for me is the Internet. I think it's an inconvenient not to provide Internet in the rooms at no cost. 

Oh I must say...the other staff members at the registration desk, housekeeping, the groundsmen, and the bellhop are all great.",2014-10-13 00:23:00

Suite was ok, I provided my own dish towels bedding & towels.  I ended up buying my own utensils and kitchenware/cookware. I got tired of asking the front desk person for items that the property did not have.  It was explained to me that the ""guests"" steal everything.

Amazingly, The front desk staff is friendly and the team works hard.  The evening clerk & the overnight clerk are extremely diligent considering that they're not provided the necessary access to do their jobs.  Overall, I sense that ESA is not properly managed and the burden of providing quality service, distribution of item amenities associated with the suite lie solely on the shoulders of the person that happens to be on duty at the front desk.  

Dirty, smelly in the common areas throughout the property.  The patrons place their garbage in the hallways outside of their door.   On weekends, trash is strewn all over the parking lot & is quite visible near the areas of outdoor trash cans.  Inconsiderate patrons reside at this property.  I'm not sure of their rationale to pollute where they temporarily live.  Perhaps if the place were managed better, the patrons would respect the property, others & themselves. 

Smokers: Quite rude & smoke their cigarettes just outside the entry/exits I think just because they can & because their just selfish people.  

I ended up leaving, yet I hope an executive manager at ESA reads my yelp experience.   Or even better, check in this dump for weekend & observe the flaws on his/her own.  Articulate expectations to management team to be carried out by the staff. 

Lastly, look diligently for your lodging needs.  I would not recommend this place.

I stayed at the Marriott Fairfield Inn and Suites in Willow Grove for 2 days in August of 2019, and the experience was less than satisfactory. The primary culprit(s) here were a raucous, inconsiderate group of people from NY that had descended on the hotel like a group of locusts for a hockey tournament apparently. These kids (and parents) were rude, inconsiderate, and just a complete bunch of jerks - letting the kids run wild in the hotel (up until about 4am one night), slamming doors, yelling, pounding up and down the hallways, etc., while the parents themselves got drunk in the hotel public areas playing cards and treating the facilities like a garbage dump. Trash, cigarette butts, ashes, pizza boxes, half-eaten food, and discarded liquor bottles were overflowing from every trash can and piled on tables everywhere. These people made the experience miserable.

The hotel said they were doing their best to control the behavior, since they had admitted they got numerous guest complaints, but the behavior kept happening. The first night was so bad that we had to ask to change rooms from the first floor from all the noise outside our room and above us. Here is where I want to acknowledge Donna and Chanel from the front desk - these two women were nothing but courteous, pleasant, and hardworking, and were one of the very few redeeming things about our stay there - Marriott, take note of these two, because they embody the experience you want your guests to have. Nothing else did.

Donna and Chanel helped us change rooms to a (slightly) quieter suite, and helped me navigate the Marriott call center (who also definitely dropped the ball on the entire experience of trying to change rooms), and continued to be polite and personable and just downright awesome the entire time. I have a feeling that if this boorish group of New York hockey idiots hadn't been there, this would be a 4 or 5 star review; however, because they were allowed to run wild and act like animals the entire weekend, ours and numerous other guests' stays were  unpleasant. You may want to ask if there are any large groups of children staying at the hotel if you intend to make reservations. I would be hesitant to book here again, but if you decide to, make sure you work with Donna and Chanel - they are the sole reason why this wasn't a one-star review!",2019-08-25 19:05:38

Grant several times a year, that is 4 families, at least 4 or more times per year, so quite a lot of regular business over the last six years.  Our father was living at the Forum Independent living complex property next door to the Sheraton on E. Grant in Tucson, so it was always very convenient.  The last few months, our visits were more frequent, as our dad was in and out of the hospital often.  He died last week, and all four of the adult siblings needed to stay at the Sheraton to arrange for dad's funeral and the closing up of his apartment.  Though the rooms at the Sheraton are fine, the cleaning staff is friendly, and the Glow Ball restaurant people are kind, I must say that all of us experienced terrible service from the front desk staff.  Rude, unprofessional, unhelpful, several reservation mistakes were made by the staff, and they were unapologetic, even when they did admit the mistakes were their own 'human error'.  It was incredibly stressful, especially with the Gem Show in town, there was no place else to stay, and the front desk had managed to bungle some of our reservations.  They were unsympathetic (they all knew we were in town to bury our father), and unyielding, unwilling to help, and it left an incredibly bitter feeling.  If I had worked the front desk, with regular clients, I would have bent over backwards to help, solve problems, be apologetic and professional, generous and kind. None of that happened.  Only upon check-out, did Pierre offer condolences.  But for the intermittent two week stay before that, the front desk was so negative, I actually avoided going through the lobby at all times.  A smile goes a long way.  A kind word. A drink voucher. A breakfast.  Any of those offerings would have helped smooth things over. But that did not happen.  Upon moving to another hotel, which was less convenient and more expensive, we still all breathed a sigh of relief that we would not have to ever step foot into the Sheraton Tucson lobby again, or ever have to again deal with the confrontational front desk staff.  Time for the Sheraton Tucson to rethink customer service- the front desk is the front line to your clients.  Learn to smile, be helpful, and accommodating.  This is, after all, a ""hospitality"" business!  
All this said- I want to compliment the bar staff for being super friendly and preparing delicious drinks.  And the new Glow Ball restaurant was really good (omg, the salmon! yum.).

Do not be surprised if they walk in your room and try to open the door while it is latched, extremely nosy extremely rude and I am now missing belongings as well as on authorized charges to my bank account that are more than I paid for the night, the one night stay I had. I arrived at 6 o'clock in the morning checked out accordingly early and they still charge me, FYI it was also my birthday July 24, I had advised against anybody to stay at this particular location hopefully not all holiday in express is our is bad as experience as this one. I don't like posting negative reviews but this had to be stated loudly and clearly. This hotel chain is ran by I HG I believe, I'm waiting to hear back from them hopefully some positive news tomorrow I will keep everybody updated.",2019-07-27 04:44:39

From the moment I checked in, I knew our experience was going to be mediocre. We had an extremely long layover,  therefore arrived at 2 AM to check in. The staff member was too busy chitchatting with her coworker about ordering cheese fries from Uber eats than to give us - paying guests, her undivided attention, or barely eye contact for that matter! Anytime I called guest services, the staff members were abrupt and very unprofessional. When I called to request housekeeping services I was rudely advised that I was to have ""notified the hotel at least 24 hours in advance!""  and how are we supposed to know this??!! Trust me when I say,  this was not a four-star hotel experience!  What a disappointment...I will say the only person whom showed kindness and courteousness was Stella in the hotel café. She's been working there for 16 years and obviously understands the importance of customer service. Next time I'll just stick to the hotels I've had GOOD experience with, the Sheraton is definitely not on the list!",2021-06-17 05:47:20

But with employees like that-it's leaning hard towards one of the worst.  She's racist and cursed at screamed across an entire parking lot at me...i ignored her because I'm not going to scream across a parking lot because she's having a bad morning. Ignoring her must have set her off cause she then called the cops on me. While waiting on the cops she's still yelling at me. It was about 6 people yelling at me, just because Alicia started yelling. The cops finally come listened to her for .5 seconds, checked to make sure i was ok and left... she was wrong. And the aggressor. No report was made. They didn't even take my name. That's how ridiculous she was. Shows me that she's always mean and calling cops. This was definitely a race issue. And i plan to escalate it appropriately.",2020-01-29 21:58:34

Didn't feel I got value for the price charged. They are trying too hard to be hip. Ill start with the positive. Hotel definitely still has brand new feel. Hallways and rooms are fresh. Has modern feel and look. Found the bed and pillows very comfortable. Food at Ralphs was good

The cons going to be longer. Just getting here was a pain, didnt find out to after I checked in that came in wrong entrance. Then there is confusion about lobby being on the third floor. Having to pay for Wi Fi was very annoying. The controls in the room didnt work great as far as adjusting heat- turned it off at one point and still got heat- if there is a true off I have not found it. The people who work here do not seem very happy. I can't say anyone was out and out rude, just a bad vibe- like you are annoying  them by being there. Think workers behind Iron Curtain

Saving the best for last. Those Showers. Oh those Showers. Jimmy Fallon or someone needs to do a bit on them. First to even turn the water on you must immerse yourself in the shower itself. Nothing like having freezing cold then scalding hot water hit your body at 6am as you frantically try to get the right temperature. And while you are doing this a small lake is forming on the side panel and floor. Kids must love it can float a few rubber ducks on the floor while showering. Am sure there is someone else out there who is traveling to the ends of the earth to find the secret behind these showers- there must be some hidden meaning in this design",2014-01-11 17:45:03

_EvdESarA2mRBpsurmYrEg,vzw72FKV_Q_Arz0WRJP8Nw,yHiSd7SxMI7UiBxqnTUWTA,1,0,0,0,"I recently got married and booked my wedding block at Holiday Inn over a year prior to my event. At the time, I was told I was the only wedding booking for that time. Although I anticipated other wedding blocks to book during that weekend as well, I was NOT expecting to be treated so terribly by the staff. First and foremost, upon booking our block my mother requested a suite for herself and my father. She was told NO, she may not have a suite because they are reserved for brides only. About a year later and closer to the event date, my mother-in-law requested a bridal suite and was told YES and booked one. I have no idea how this discrepancy in policy took place, seeing as my mother was told no and also my partner warned this vendor that her mother is problematic, abusive, manipulative and not to receive special treatment. When I brought this to Angela and Dawn's attention, they did absolutely nothing to amend the situation. In fact, I continued to receive very patronizing emails from Dawn, instructing me to ""RELAX"" and ""ENJOY my special day"" (yes, she really typed in caps, as if yelling at me). Additionally, when I arrived for my event, I politely informed the front desk associate that I was the bride and hoping my maid-of-honor, who was standing beside me and for whom I already booked a room, could be placed in a room in close proximity to mine. The front desk associate was incredibly curt and rude, stating that he has three other weddings to worry about and he can't make any promises. Again, I had told him that I wasn't just any guest, I was the BRIDE of the wedding--the one who booked over a year prior to the event and paying a lot of money for at least three rooms. I did not receive a warm welcome, I did not receive any special accommodations. I was treated like garbage, perhaps due to my age and same-sex wedding. I received many other complaints from guests about the front desk associates being incredibly rude and many of my guests were NOT given the welcome bags that I had spent a lot of time and money putting together. I felt incredibly discriminated against as a young gay woman, and I warn other brides, grooms, and marriers (especially LGBTQ couples) to NOT book their wedding-block here. I spent a lot of money on at least three rooms, and I would have expected my suite to be comped given the issues I had to endure. However, this was not the case.

We got booked into hotel and got our room. Only problem was ....it was not the suite we asked for. Just a regular room. We then went back down to the lobby to fix the situation and after half an hour , we finally got the room we ordered. 

The suite was really specious and had extra ammenitiies such as a scale. The room was severely neglected by housecleaning. There was blood / wine stains all over the room ( including the sheets ) . The bathroom walls were also not clean with fecal matter all over the place . The sink also did not drain properly and took forever to get hot water. Heater was also not on and was blasting cold air ( got sick while in the room ).


The area around the pool was nice. The pool itself again looked neglected . The water looked Greenish/ blue foggy with what I could see fecal matter/ garbage. The jacuzzi looked cleaned , but the pumps were not working.

The exercise room was nice . Clean, had alot of dumbells , weights , and treadmills . The coconut water was also a nice touch .Only con would be that the keycard system to get in DOES NOT WORK . Anyone without a hotel room can go in which is worrysome.

The Lobby looked exceptional and the buffet was not badly priced at all. The restaurant looked upscale besides seeing empty used cocktail glasses around 6:30-7 AM. Servers were very friendly and helpfull.

I just wish that they took better time with the rooms rather than first impressions . It was overly dirty for what the prices were ( so much that it would be deemed Department of health worthy ) .

Upon entering the room it smelled like vomit. So we put our stuff down and tried to find what was causing such a smell. The bathroom......! There was vomit on the floor on the toilet, walls, door, wood shelf under sink for towels....YES THERE WAS VOMIT ON THE TOWELS LEFT FOR US TO USE!  So it had been a long trip we were hungry went downstairs gave our information to the gal that checked us in, she was shocked and stated it will be rechecked  immediately. We(myself husband father) stayed we would be picking up family at airport and then going to dinner that should be more than enough time to have the restroom cleaned so we can use it. 

Upon our return........NOTHING WAS CLEANED. They only sprayed a bunch of febreeze to mask the smell.  nothing was wiped down nothing was clean. I went down the front desk,  thinking I'd be able to get someone in there to clean. I was told manager was busy and I'd have to wait. The young girl I think her name was Alyssa was so rude stating they sent someone up to the room I must be wrong! Wth really? FYI finish college honey and maybe hit the books a little harder or take a business course and learn some customer service and manners too!  I THE CUSTOMER have a problem I come to YOU for help, I GIVE YOUR ESTABLISHMENT $$$ in exchange for services rendered. My $$ pays for your payroll or do you think payroll is just something freely given??  I digress, While I waited 10 mins for him(I think his name was Marshall) to come out of his office(seriously at like 10pm what else needed his attention? It felt like he was he doing it on purpose to run out the clock. No customer service) while I was waiting I watched the cleaning lady look at me and smile and giggle and leave for the night. The manager came out shortly after. He was rude from the start stating he had no idea what I was talking about and the cleaning lady had just left for the night and that they both went into my room and saw nothing.....so I took pictures of everything prior to walking down to speak to him. Smh I showed him the photos and he stated again that house keeping is gone for the night and he would have maintenance come up to the room. They did not come up so I went and bought disinfectant wipes from the cvs around the corner and cleaned the bathroom myself. While I WAS CLEANING UP maintenance came up with disinfectant wipes, the same Lysol shit I bought. I asked him if he smelt anything in here still and he said yeah who puked...I asked him to clean the bathroom again and bring some bleach or something strong and fresh towels....never happened.... while I went to get a drink at the bar to relax since I couldn't do it in my room. And no not the bar inside the hotel the one around the corner. 

I wanted to change rooms but was told nothing else was available, by the same night manager as before. 

The room was never cleaned by staff and I did it myself. Not only did we pay $2000.00 plus to stay at the motel opps I meant hotel or maybe not, I had to clean it myself. Because it doesn't matter how much febreeze you spray if you don't clean up vomit the smell stays.....why because it's human bile, stomach acids and digested food and it's gross beyond words. 

We were comped a breakfast for myself and each guest with but honestly if you cant clean a bathroom right I'm not about to eat anything cooked there either. And instead of doing it to my face the note was slipped under my door. No acknowledgment of how disgusting it is to find someone else puke in your room. 

We will not be returning next yr and have already made other arrangements. I understand it's a college area and that kids can be stupid and grosss but I am however a tax paying adult on vaca/ business for the gem and mineral show, which my family has been a part of since the 1970's. We like to try different places in Tucson when we go especially since everything is changing but we won't be going to this Marriott again.  I'm adding all the photos I took of the bathroom too bad I couldn't provide the smell that I had to endure. FYI there wasn't anything available anywhere at the time we went Tucson books up quickly when the gem and mineral show is going on, it's an international show.......smh Marriott. I wanted to scream I've been treated better at a motel 6 than this. It wasn't like this the yr prior, it was clean the staff were great I don't know what happened.

First and foremost, you want a good night's sleep at a hotel. Well good flipping luck here! The bed is rock hard, the pillows are huge and fluffy until you lay on them, then they reduce to the thickness of a sheet of printer paper, and fluff around your face. So it kind of feels like being smothered. Also, for some odd reason, I'm itching like crazy when I get into this bed, and I feel like I'm having trouble breathing. Worst bed, worst pillows I have ever tried sleeping on. Got about 2 hours the first night, 5 the second only because of how exhausted I was. I'm incredibly upset!!!!!!!!!

The elevators are incredibly slow and just crappy in general. I can let that slide to be honest, but just wanted to mention for full disclosure. 

The fan in the bathroom is a joke. Barely moves any air. 

The ironing board provided was pretty stained and yellow. Not that I even expected an ironing board to be in the room, but dang... That thing looks disgusting! 

The ""club room"" isn't particularly worth the extra $15/night in my opinion. It's a room with a coffee dispenser/maker, an ancient toaster, a mini-fridge stocked with soda, fruit juice, and water, and sometimes they put out some weird looking pita bread and other finger foods. 

The staff has been very pleasant in my limited interactions with them, and housekeeping did a decent job. That's really the only positives to be honest. I come back to the bed point... The whole purpose of a hotel is to get a good night's sleep when you're away from home.

I was finally directed to the General Manager who was also exceptionally rude (he hung up on me). He agreed to take $250 off the bill. So I was still charged over $500 for one night of stay. 
I mean, to treat a member this way who has stayed multiple times at your hotel is just disgusting.

This is what happened at my last stay. At approximately 11:57 PM, on August 12, I was going to go down to speak with the front desk clerk to report excessive noise. I exited my room and saw two fellow guests as they were exiting the fourth floor staircase which was located next to my room. These guests were going to their room. Then the female guest made a comment to her male companion. ""Told you to be quiet"" I then proceeded to the elevator. I made a comment of, people are trying to sleep. She started yelling immediately shifting her focus to me and held her male companion back from going into the elevator That I was in. I was so scared that I couldn't push the right buttons to get to the lobby. 

 These guests instead of going to their room, proceeded to follow me down by using the elevators and NOT THE STEPS THEY WERE USING ALL NIGHT LONG! As I'm trying to speak to the night clerk, I was then ambushed by these two guests who repeatedly interrupted me and prevented me from speaking to her by bullying me! 

Of course, I began to raise my voice to the clerk so she could hear me. Then appeared a security guard. After the guests used a barrage of racial slurs it didn't stop there. Others began to join in with them. The Female guest was quite intent in threatening me into believing that I was going to be physically harmed so I quickly returned to my room and used the added locks on my door on the inside. 

There was a security guard. He entered the lobby when I was returning to my room. The security guard did absolutely nothing. Allowing this incident to escalate rather quickly. The female Guest, Now knowing what room I was in, returned to the fourth floor rather quickly. She then began to slam the hallway door, her door and continued yelling. barraging me full of racial slurs. This continued until well after 01:00. Preventing me from using my room. The only difference Michael, I'm there for medical care. They were inebriated Guests. Under the influence of what ever and harassed me! 



Racism goes both ways Michael! Open Up your eyes and stop ignoring what's happening around you! The clerk told me that she was subjected to this kind of behavior before and often enough what should never be tolerated by anybody.

I recommend these rooms as they are large and are organized in a 6-plex building with outdoor patios or balconies making them feel more private than the posada rooms. The rooms have been remodeled recently with large stone showers, leatherette chairs and couches, very plush memory foam/pillow top mattresses, and the rooms retain the wood beamed ceilings. On this stay we booked a view room which overlooked the city of Tucson. Since we checked in after dark, it was nice to see the city lights from our patio. The bed felt almost too soft at first, as if there was 6 inches of pillow top/memory foam, but it actually slept very well and the pillows were a down/feather mix and very comfortable. However, It is not the best bed for propping  yourself up the read as you sink in too much making it hard to find a comfortable position.

The resort has a great workout room with views of Pusch Ridge, a large lap pool and numerous tennis courts. I have used the first two amenities several times. The grounds include a short walking trail and nice desert plantings and even several grapefruit trees which were ripe enough to pick in late December if you can reach them.

I have not tried the restaurant recently, but we used to go for Sunday brunch and the great view of the city.

One nit pick on this trip is that room service trays from the neighboring room sat around for two days before being picked up. A bigger issue and reason for only 4 stars is that our patio door glass was badly fogged and needed to be replaced. As you pay a bit more for a view room, the view should be clearly visible from inside your room, not just from the patio. The fogged glass obscured the view significantly.",2021-12-29 23:18:43

We really liked it -- the location and the grounds are great, with views and walking trails. We also liked the fact that it was not a high end, corporate, golf course sort of resort. It had a nice, casual and comfortable feel to it. Our girls loved taking the guided horseback rides. We overlooked any shortcomings because it worked for us -- and it was reasonably priced.

Fast forward ten years. My wife and I love Tucson so we decided to come here for a few days at New Years. Unfortunately, ""comfortable"" has turned into ""shabby"" and the place seems to have gone downhill, like they haven't done anything to maintain or improve it. Very surprising since it has been owned by Wyndham for over six years now.

My wife checked in and had an unfriendly, unhelpful person. After my wife asked if anything was going on at New Years he said not really, even though they were going to have FIREWORKS, which we missed because we didn't know about them. Then, we went to the room and there was an awful smell and the patio out the back was dirty. So we requested a different room and that same clerk had an attitude about it, and again was unhelpful in terms of letting us know what was going on. We finally got another room, carried everything in from the car, and discovered the mini-fridge was missing. Called the front desk and this time got a woman who was apologetic and helpful and had a fridge brought to our room within about ten minutes.

Although Westward Look is less expensive than some of the other area resorts (Westin La Paloma, Hacienda Del Sol), we will no longer stay there. It's just too rundown and in need of upgrading. The room furniture is distressed and not intentionally. The unmovable part of the sliding glass door did not seal so we had a cold draft in our room (it was 30 degrees at night). They have begun to put tarps on the roofs, apparently to prevent leaking instead of fixing or replacing the roofs -- we had someone putting a tarp on our roof the day before rain was forecast.

Stayed here because it was cheap. With that being said, I do not expect a five star hotel. I read the reviews and saw quite the mix between good and bad. 

The bad: 
- Upon arriving to the room, the first thing you see is the filthy carpet. I think filthy might be an understatement. It was bad. Definitely vacuumed, but stained like nothing I've seen before. 
- There are also some brown decorative pillows on the bed. 2/3 had some very lovely mystery stains on them. Not something I want touching a pillow that will eventually touch my head. 
- The parking situation is also an absolute disaster. Two large hotels on one property means a severe lack of parking. Luckily, we squeezed into the last spaces each evening. If you plan on coming in late, good luck. The street parking is also not the best. There was a car on blocks just down the street. 
- On the second day, we went down to the front desk to let them know we were heading out and ready for our room to be serviced. We were met with ""I'll let the housekeeper know, but I can't promise anything because we are short today."" This was in a pretty rude tone. 
- There was also ants in the bathroom. Lots of ants.

Our room overlooked the pool which is huge along with fountains gushing from the ground for the children to run through.  They also have another smaller pool over to the side which appears to be more private.  Then of course there is the lazy river (tubes provided) with a small water slide which is a great way to relax.  There is fresh flavored water (cucumbers, ctirus, mint) jugs everywhere around the resort.  So yummy and refreshing.  

As my husband and I were enjoying the lazy river, we decided to order two blended Mojito's (something we experienced in the Caribbean).  Well, the waitress and bartender seemed to forget our order and we reminded the waitress. She brought them right away and said they are ""on the house"" and apologized for the delay.  They were delicious considering the bartender never made a blended Mojito before she said.

One Tequila shot is served to everyone on the patio at 5:30 with a wonderful story about Pancho Villa.  The warm evenings are so pleasant with the firepits.

Starbucks on site and a few shops.  Self parking is quite a distance from the rooms. 

Beautiful stay at this resort and wonderful service.  We felt miles away from home and work yet we only live an hour from this resort.",2013-10-15 18:31:53

So I had to give up having a room with micro/fridge to check in right then. They did comp me parking for the inconvenience which I was glad since it's $35 per day!!!!! We spent the day at the Zoo & looked forward to cooling off at the rooftop pool. Only to find it packed to over the capacity amount of non family friendly people. Shortly after the staff had to close the pool to be shocked and cleaned due to the overload and behavior of this huge rude group. 
I purposely looked for a hotel with pool to enjoy with my kids and it was locked up after that and we never got to swim!
Our room was not clean. Sheets were clean but the floors, shelves and bath were not. We decided to stay there for dinner and sat for 20 mins without even being Acknowledged by staff. (It wasn't busy) it was 5pm! I finally went to the bar stood for another few mins and got me and my children drinks which I carried to them myself! Then again had to go to the bar and order food which seemed to really annoy the bartender as she chatted with other bar customers about how busy her night would be with the airline people coming in and that she didn't really like it!  We then waited over 45 mins for simple menu items. We were not brought silverware or napkins. I basically acted as our waitress. It was extremely disappointing because the hotel portrays a higher class image online. But it is Not. Again had the same experience at the morning breakfast buffet. Sat at the table with no acknowledgment from staff or servers. I walked up to the bar and got menus and silverware myself Again! Finally a man said he was new and not sure what to do. We helped ourselves to the buffet and finally 10 mins later had a waiter who wasn't even sure if you could order from a menu or the price of buffet.  Needless to say I won't stay at This hotel on my next trip in Philly. Only good part (if you can stand all the rest) is it's close to historic sites and you can walk, but I would do so with great caution. Not the best part of town to walk alone or unalert in.",2017-07-19 11:44:04

And for the amount I spent to stay there I expected excellent guest services and accommodations. The front desk staff was rude to me on arrival. When I entered my room there was trash on the floor left over from the housekeeping service, as well as dresser drawers pulled open. I did not mention this to anyone as mistakes can happen. However, the next day when I returned to my room after housekeeping had cleaned it, there was a toilet brush left on my dresser. I felt that to be disgusting. When I approached the housekeeping staff on the floor I was met with an attitude. When I called down to the front desk to speak to housekeeping management, I was told I would receive a call back shortly which never happened. I called management the next day who was apologetic and accommodated my inconvenience, but I felt the need to request no one enter my room further. I did not feel comfortable staying there with such negative back and forth.

The woman at the front desk was amazing, and so sweet. She really was very helpful and provided a map so we could find our room and party without any issues.
Our room had a very large bathroom with separate tub and shower, a king size bed, and two chairs. We had a beautiful patio that overlooked the parking lot, but a hill was built up in such a way that you couldn't see or hear any traffic while you were seated. Plus, when you get to see two big barrel cacti and an ocotillo while enjoying your first morning cup, who cares?
The ballroom was beautiful, and the food served at the party was fantastic. The jalapeno macaroni and cheese is the best, and I loved how everything had labels to say if it was gluten free, vegetarian, or vegan. 
I forgot my contact lens case, and only remembered this when the sundries shop was closed. My husband went to the front desk and they gave him one for a dollar twenty.

So glad we didn't pay full price for our stay!  We knew we were getting a 3 star hotel but didn't expect unfriendly and dirty.  I mean, we spent a night in a 3 star hotel before and the staff was really friendly/helpful and the room was clean as can be for a hotel room.  I can get over the unfriendly staff because it wasn't like they were rude or anything but they certainly didn't make you feel welcomed.  At first the room appeared to seem decent and clean but when it came to shower, mold and mildew was noticeable.  I used a washcloth that we weren't going to use and wiped some of it to see if was lack of trying to clean or if it was a really stubborn issue.   Well, it was definitely a lack of using some elbow grease to clean it because it came right off.  After we got ready to go out for the night and were waiting for the elevator, we noticed that the mirror was not just streaky but it was dirty streaky like no one has touched it in awhile.  The next morning, as I was packing my belongings, I noticed that there were dark stains by the area where you put your feet.  We wouldn't even seen that if it wasn't for my boyfriend who tends to move around a lot.  In my opinion, the maid had to of seen that and should have put other ones on.  Yes the hotel is convenient but not convenient enough for us to ever stay in place that felt like no one cares to take care of it.

Thank goodness my sister got in before I did.  She let me know that none of us had a room.  My confirmation email clearly gave me the exact dates I had reservations for.  She was able to get her room straightened out but not mine they didn't have any more rooms so my hubby and I hurried to find another one before we got there so we could have a place to sleep. My sister said the double tree had room 264 reserved for us the rest of the weekend. I got over it although I was not too happy about having to unpack and pack twice.  When I got there I asked for an upstairs room but the bottom one was the only one available very far from my family members. I didn't like her tone and the fact she would not look at me and spoke over me talking to my sister.  She was just very condescending.  Instead she smiled and gave me a cookie lol. Oh I wanted to climb over that counter and ugh nevermind...

Later the event went well but then our family got together at the Cantina and the food and beverage person Mike was so rude to my 70 year old aunt and barked at her like a small little chihuahua saying if any more relatives come we will need to cut them off. At that point about 30% of the family left and some if us stayed.  It wasn't our fault they would ran out of food and alcohol (which tasted watered down. Yes Mike we did notice). We were having a great time. Some of us were watching the baseball game some of us were taking selfies. None of us were drunk. When my brother ordered a round of shot Mike barked at him too saying you're cut off like some kind of mastiff drueling and spitting out of his mouth lol. My hubby finally asked him why have you been so rude to our family all evening?  His only answer was I can decide to be and stated would you like to leave now?

Also, I stayed at a Hampton a couple weeks ago and they had a good free breakfast. This shabby Hilton charges you $15.

Nickel-and-diming customers is NOT luxury. Folding a triangle in your toilet paper and paying a poor immigrant minimum wage to open the entrance door is NOT luxury. This place is clearly phoning it in and trading in on a name.

zxjQbn4nxgZvGYdnrtosfQ,N9_YehYdYfZ2QgbDZtY_6g,lZX5_8qspEXtMJGFQ0-Mow,4,1,1,0,"I came to the Marriott Downtown for the yearly huge ISTE conference (largest EdTech conference in the world w/18K+people!) at the Philadelphia convention center.

Check in was unusually rough & annoying. As a member of the ISTE Board of Directors I had a king room reserved near an elevator - it wasn't ready early at 1:00pm when I came in all hot & sticky from the Amtrak train, cab, & a 100degree humid June day. It wasn't until after my 9pm meeting (and a temporary dbl room to change & a wasted $20 tip to desk mgr. ) that they finally got me into Rm 1076 - a lovely King near the elevator - on the side of the building that is closest to the 3rd floor bridge to the Convention Center which is key because the hallways are FOOTBALL FIELD LENGTH LONG! Whew! Seriously, if you're coming for a conference at the convention center and don't want to add another 10 min walk each way to your room make sure you get a high numbered room!

The newly renovated room was gorgeous! 42"" LCD LG TV, sleek marble bathroom w/rain shower head, crisp sheet covered feather duvet & a plethora of pillows. It also had a nice view of the rotating guitar of the Hard Rock Cafe. Sadly, the bed hurt my back (unlike the Sofitel!)  so I asked for another feather duvet & with judicious doubling up created a feather bed topper. I also asked for a REFRIGERATOR which was not standard for bottles of water, Diet Coke, and fruit. Nice that they delivered it & plugged it in whilst I was at a meeting. The Marriott is a Pepsi hotel but there's a 7-11 out the front door and a Wine & Spirits shop out the back door (across the street from the outdoor cafe) Also close by a Hard Rock Cafe, Melting Pot, & an Italian place where I had a lovely but pricey lunch called Maggiano's.

Hotels will generally try and provide items that you need if they are not included. I've previously requested table or box fans to put me to sleep and provide air movement - too bad the Marriott didn't have any. Always TIP WELL when you are brought a requested item & thank them with a warm grateful smile!

There are 2 lobby bars - one in the middle of the lboby that's round, contemporary, pretty, comfy, but usually full and another Level 13 across the bank of elevators. Handy for meetings as they have a few tables near outlets for laptops - SCORE! Prices for drinks are high - $9.00 for a glass of Chardonnay and $7 for a bottle of Yeuingling.

Much has been said on Trip Advisor & Yelp about the rude service but after I got into my room the people were all lovely and accommodating as could be! I had 2 ROOM SERVICE meals that were delivered faster than estimated, piping hot, & tasty with only one hitch. I was disappointed when the cheapest ($40) bottle of Chardonay listed on the menu for an impromptu afternoon wine & cheese party was found to be unavailable with a call back 5 min after I ordered ..OK, let's try next one ($45) .....4 min wait on hold...No? Ok, the next one ($51) 3 min wait on hold...Nope! The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay avail from the room service staff was $65 ...What the heck!? Miffed, I canceled the whole thing and met my friends at the hotel lobby bar instead where.....the elusive $40 bottle of wine was available. I never did figure that out, but buying the whole bottle for wine and cheese party for 5 was just perfect and saved $10 bucks! Hey, I'm thrifty! 

The doormen were lovely & hailed cabs quick as a wink but the concierge gave questionable advice when looking for a place to eat steak & seafood. They recommended the Philadelphia Chart House (well known to me because of their sister properties in Annapolis & Baltimore) but the reviews on Yelp for this one were HORRIBLE! We ended up going to the Capital Grille (see my review) that was just amazing.

The walk from the hotel to the largest Terrace Ballroom going through the Convention Center is a LONG TREK! Like 5 blocks all inside & lovely but far, far, away! The Reading Terminal Market is also nearby with stalls of food & other delectable just make sure to keep your purse zipped & secured - a friend of mine had her wallet stolen whilst there this week...and that was just a shame!

WIRELESS Internet was NOT FREE & had some odd charges but it was fast & reliable. I'm still mystified how the Hampton Inn can a offer free brekkie and free wireless but fancy shmancy places like this can't or....don't.

All in all my 7 nights at the Marriott Downtown were great. Clean hotel, nice refurbished rooms, LOVED having HBO for my True Blood & Game of Thrones fix and staff that really - if approached with a warm smile, were gracious & accommodating! Thank you!

The Marriott is considered a 4 star hotel by Priceline, and that is what I am giving them in this Yelp review. The hotel was extremely well located for our visit as we were doing an eating and drinking crawl mostly centered around 12th and Sansom. I found our room to be perfectly adequate with the only quibble being a little bit of peeling paint in the bathroom above the shower. The shower itself was in an outdated bathtub surrounded by really outdated tile. It was clear that most of the bathroom had been updated sometime in the past 10 years, but they just ignored the tub and tile. Oh well. My wife did tell me that the whole hotel is going to have a major uplift soon, so maybe they'll get that. 

The bed was extremely comfortable (the mattress was neither to soft nor too firm), but the sheets, oddly enough, seemed slightly too small for the king bed. The decor of the room was fitting for a 4 star, not too opulent and not too blah. I enjoyed it. Ice machines were well located to all rooms on our floor, which came in handy as we had brought a bottle of bubbly.  I think we walked by 3 of them?

VdZbv1sm_5ZOL1f5VEBB0A,ZvNP4yV-3fz1MTlBWcUI9g,EYoA7Zwg92rDj6pMAQQLTA,4,2,0,0,"To quote a famous politician we all know, ""Let me be clear"" --- the only reason that the Starr Pass doesn't get 5 stars from me is because I reserve 5 stars for businesses with which I can find no faults whatsoever.  Bear in mind that the issues I point out are, admittedly, nit-picky.  We've stayed here 4 or 5 times now in different rooms in different parts of the resort, so I'm qualified to offer a review that's based on more than just a single experience.

First, here's what I really like about the place:

-The grounds: Talk about a gorgeous setting!  This massive resort is perched at the top of a canyon and overlooks the valley below.  It's a little rough getting up to the resort, including a jail at the bottom of the hill, but it becomes nicer and nicer the further up the road you go.  TIP: Ask for a room with a balcony that overlooks either of the pool areas, preferably the main pool.  Before you agree to a room over the lazy river pool, make sure there's not a special ""family weekend"" event planned.  One year, Nickelodeon had a weekend event that made the area SUPER LOUD.  If you can't get a balcony room (there aren't many), just be sure to get on the pool side.  The back side of the hotel overlooks the parking lot and a steep hillside.  Yep, we did that...once.

-The workout room: AWESOME!  Hands down the largest, best equipped workout room I've seen in a hotel.  It includes a bunch of free weights, various cardio machines, and a complement of Reebok cable-style machines for a complete workout.  Open 24 hrs/day for off-hour workouts.  They have complimentary towels, a water cooler, a big bowl of granny smith apples, and even complimentary earbuds for watching TV while doing cardio.  TIP: Seems busiest right before dinner (3-5 pm).

-The staff: Haven't had a negative experience with staff yet.  Everyone seems friendly and helpful, from bellhops to valets to front desk staff.  I know, I know, you should be able to take this for granted these days, but we've all experienced rude staff, even at the nicest resorts.


Here are a few (minor) criticisms:

-The rooms: The Deluxe rooms are clean, elegant, and well-maintained.  That being said, they won't knock your socks off.  The bathrooms, in particular, don't quite hold up to other resorts I've stayed at at this price point.  I'd love to see a bathtub sized for 2, instead of a standard tub.  Ditto for the shower, which is so small you can't even get out of the water to lather up.  If a phenomenal room experience is important to you, think about stepping up to a suite.

-The location: The secluded locale is a double-edged sword.  Once your at the resort, you're AT THE RESORT.  Your 10 minutes or so to South Tucson and the closest off-site restaurant, and closer to 30 if you like to do things in the north foothills or Encantada area.  Some people never leave the grounds when they vacation, while others like to be in the middle of it all.  If you fall into the latter crowd, you should explore your options on the north side of town, such as the Westin La Paloma.

Overall, this is a great resort that we enjoy visiting every spring.",2011-05-01 18:19:02
JxIk6pT3yX8Gr3bZ31OkwQ,B-HrTYygIts3Ekl0rpLt2g,VEsI9_aDFzIrk8wh0QCOAw,1,2,1,0,"I give this hotel one star ONLY for housekeeping.  And by that I mean our room was clean.  There were only two towels in it though, and we had two adults and two kids.
My problems started before I even got there.  We were travelling from out of town for a wedding.  There was a block of rooms we could reserve from at a discounted rate so naturally I took advantage of this.  When I called the Wednesday before we would be checking in (on a Saturday) to check on my reservation and request we be placed on the same floor as others, they mysteriously had lost my reservation.  So I did another one, but SHOCKER, the blocked room rate had expired.  So now I was having to pay $100 more a night.  I was seriously pissed.   My children were in the actual wedding and this is the hotel where all the getting ready was happening so I didn't have much of a choice to stay elsewhere, plus, everywhere else close was booked.  No apologies, I was even called ""Cheap"" and suggested I stay at the ""motel 6 by the airport"" and hung up on.  I finally got a room reserved at $239 a night.  Ugh.  

Upon check in, the valet guy was EXTREMELY rude to me.  I had my son with my and my daughter and husband were at a relatives home.  We had gone to check in and get everything settled so we wouldn't have to do it later.  I told him I was just checking in and would be back in 5 minutes, if he wanted to go park the car just to turn around and go get it then that was entirely up to him.  I was told that if I was checking in then I would need to stay at the hotel.   Excuse me?

At the front desk I encountered Jessica.  I asked about being on the same floor as our other family members and rather than admit  had made a mistake and had NOT noted our accounts as previously requested, she simply told me that my relatives had cancelled their stays.......   Whatever

The room was...ok.  The beds were comfy and things seemed clean.  There were only two towels.  TV worked intermittently.   There is no vent in the bathroom so when you take a hot shower everything fogs up immediately and gets very hot and steamy.  This is what we believe is the cause of the wallpaper we found in the living area to be peeling and covered in mold.  

I had called Saturday around 7:30 for extra towels and a couple blankets because my kids were camping out on the floor.   After an hour passed, I called again.  It took almost two hours.  Then the next morning I had a message saying they were trying to deliver my towels and blankets and that they got no answer at our door so they left them outside the door.  Which was just a straight lie.   First of all, why would you deliver those things the morning after I needed them?  2nd, there was nothing outside my door, and when you say you came by and knocked, we were all there.  They didnt even realize that, even though late, someone had made it up there the night before.   Again, whatever.

The pool......  Sure.  there is a cute little indoor pool.  It is tiny, which is fine.   People dont travel to this hotel to play in the pool.  It is a nice little amenity, but not necessary.  But if you are going to have a pool, for the love of Pete, take care of it.  Water was absolutely disgusting.  My daughter who is just over 3 feet was standing in the water and I couldnt even see her feet.  The pool deck is made out of the most ridiculous tile that might as well be a sheet of ice when it gets wet.  I cannot tell you how many people fell just walking on the surface, including myself, who didnt even get in the pool, and both of my kids.  Walking, not running.  The towels they leave out for you, which again, is a nice bonus, had holes in them and I am not sure the last time they had been washed was.

The hallways and lobby of this hotel are not air conditioned.   It was 95 degrees over the weekend.  Getting ready for a wedding, going in between rooms and getting kids ready, was a disaster in the heat.  Why on earth you can't spring for AC in the hallways I will never understand.   Also, the vending/ice room, hotter than hades.  

Checkout sucked.  They tried to charge me for things that were not mine, like bottles of wine, souvenir mugs, a bunch of crap that didn't belong to me.  Valet was rude, once again.

The final charge that came out of my credit card was over $600 and I am still not even sure what for.  What was supposed to be a $300 room stay turned into double that, and a horrible experience.  I think it is safe to say that we will never ever stay in this hotel ever again.  

Oh and we saw mice in the hallway as well.  :)",2016-06-02 14:30:26

Our whole team believes the entire stay of 6 rooms for 4 nights should have been completely compensated. They disagreed. What do you all think?***


To Whom It May Concern:

My 24 teammates and I just had the worst experience at a hotel we could possibly imagine. From April 8-12, our college gymnastics team stayed at the Marriott for a competition. No one could have predicted or expected the amount of problems we were about to experience. Since I do not like to let one bad experience ruin something for me, I have decided to reach out to the corporate office to give Marriott International a second chance.

Our first travel issue was not related to the hotel. Our connecting flight from Denver, CO to Philadelphia was delayed for 4 hours due to weather and changed our ETA from 11:30pm April 8 to 4am April 9. We immediately called the Marriott hotel and explained our situation; they assured us that everything would be fine and we could check in once we arrived. By the time we landed, deplaned, and got a shuttle to the hotel, it was 5am. Our team was ready to go straight to our rooms because our girls team had their prelims competition starting at 8am that same day and our guys team had to support them until our prelims started at 12:30pm.
 
When we got to the front desk and tried checking in, none of our six rooms were available for our 24-person team. We were told that they were under maintenance and the staff worked on getting us temporary rooms that we could stay in for the next few hours. The front desk comped all of our rooms for the first night because of this, and eventually we had our keys to the temporary rooms that had to be vacant by noon. We gave them the phone number to our travel coordinator and made it very clear to use that number to contact our team about any issues or resolutions that they needed to communicate with us.

Later that morning, the girls team was checked out and competing. Soon, all of the rooms were ready and our members began moving bags to the new rooms. Not even an hour after switching rooms however, were we told that half of the new rooms were not correct and we needed to switch rooms again. Finally, all of our belongings were moved to their correct rooms. Never got a call for any of this.

While our guys team was competing at the convention center down the street and the girls team was cheering us on, there was an issue with a credit card not transferring over to the new rooms. The front desk only attempted to contact us by calling these empty rooms and leaving voicemails. Again, they neglected to call our travel coordinator and...deactivated our room cards.

When we got back to the front desk, confused why our keys stopped working, we resolved the credit card issue...but the room keys continued to stop working for just about each room at least 2 more times that night. This is still Thursday, the same day we arrived.

Later that evening, the door to one of the girls' rooms is activated and opens. A random man enters and confusingly demands to know why they are in his room. The girls, completely surprised and taken aback as some were changing, ask him the same. Eventually he leaves. Apparently, the front desk allowed that room to be checked out by somebody else even though it was occupied. The front desk staff robotically apologized and offered a $200 voucher for the hotel restaurant.

Friday, there was another credit card issue...Our travel coordinator never got a call from the front desk...We Finally were able to get ahold of a manager and he...assured us that there wouldn't be any more issues at the hotel.

On Saturday evening, all of the room keys to just my hotel room stopped working again. We went back to the front desk to get all of our rooms comped for the entire stay because of how frustrating, inconvenient, and ridiculous all of these issues were. The same manager said that the best he could do was comp our one room for that one night only.
 
Our entire team left that hotel having been through the worst travel experience of our lives. The fact that there were as many issues as there were (especially safety concerns of checking out a room twice) ...staff...managers...indifferent to our situation made everything worse. Our team is comprised of friendly, respectful, hospitable people, and we give and expect that from businesses and other people whenever we travel. This is my first attempt at contacting Marriott International, Inc. to allow them the opportunity to show its customers the hospitality that they expected.

Thank you for your time, I look forward to your response.",2015-07-30 17:32:56

The hotel is obviously older, bathrooms are quite small, but the beds are super duper comfy and the pillows were awesome. 

Complaints: staff wasn't super friendly. They weren't rude, but I'm used to people who at least smile back at me, which I didn't get here. 

Biggest issue: the toilet paper. Stay with me on this - remember when your dad would rip up a Kleenex into little pieces and then pretend to sneeze, scattering little fuzz pieces everywhere? Well that is what the tp in my room bathroom did when it was touched. I'll leave what it did when used to your imagination.

The actual hotel administration and staff are helpful, accommodating, and have more than earned my respect. However, a recent experience at the hotel bar, 'Circ', has left me a bit...peeved.

To frame the narrative, I was there one night during a convention. The lobby was bustling, and the alcohol was flowing. I was just starting my night, and had ordered a single beer from a nice bartender. Going for my next round, I positioned myself at the opposite, less crowded side of the bar. I proceeded to stand there quietly, accordingly waiting to be served.

I knew things were busy, but I noticed that the bartender in that area kept passing over me, not acknowledging my existence at all. After a while I got the feeling it wasn't just because the place was busy; I was deliberately being ignored. I remained fast, and the internal timer was reaching almost half an hour. It sounds ridiculous that someone would wait that long, but I'm a person of principle. Eventually an older woman came up next to me, and when she was propositioned, she asked for a glass of wine, but then was nice enough to tell him that I had been waiting longer and should be served first. The bartender paused, then leaned in to me and snarked ""Just so you know, this is what happens when you don't take care of your bartenders."" 

It caught me completely off guard. All I could reply with was ""...huh?"" and then he turned away to pour the woman's glass of wine. I sort of stood there, dumbfounded. Another younger woman at my other side looked at me with an ""Is he serious?"" face, and I mimicked it back.

Now, I completely understand how tipped employment works, and have a lot of empathy for the strenuous work it entails. I am NOT Mr. Pink, and normally leave a very generous tip after being served. In regards to bar settings, I will usually start to tip on the second beer, or if I firstly order a mixed drink that requires preparation, or order multiple drinks at once. But..I hadn't even been served by this man yet. I'm not some snooty, pretentious partier. I wasn't asking for him to move heaven and earth...only for him to crack open a single bottle of beer. 

Logically, I can only figure a couple scenarios: One, my first bartender was upset that I didn't tip, and then colluded with this other one. I find that to be unlikely, because he didn't seem at all upset with me and was very amicable. Two, the bartender in question profiled that I had exact change in my hand, and assumed that I wasn't going to tip him. I did have exact change, because why would I break a large bill when I have the exact amount? I don't hand over the tip until I've been served, where I'll go back into my wallet and leave it on the bar. I had plenty of money to be spent at the bar that night, both for drinks and tips. In fact, I entirely planned on ""taking care"" of him for the (unrealized) sale. It seems like whatever chip on his shoulder this guy had, he lost out on a lot of money both for himself AND the business who employs him. This complaint is less about tipping protocol...more the passive-aggressive, condescending manner that he treated a paying customer. Unfortunately, a bad employee reflects upon the establishment.

I turned around and walked straight out of the lobby, gave the money I would have spent to the homeless man sleeping on the sidewalk outside the hotel, and went to drink at a real bar.

So, if you want to stay at the Marriott Downtown Philadelphia, it's a great hotel. Just avoid the bar like the plague, go somewhere that's worth the money.

And to the mid-life-crisis bartender with the tacky gold pinky ring, p*** off, mate.",2014-12-03 05:14:37

The first thing wrong was not go to Yelp to see the reviews before I booked the hotel. I didn't look at the reviews until the day after. HUGE MISTAKE!!!!!!

The pictures from this place made me want to vomit. Who allows their property to willingly look this way. I rushed back over to booking.com to request a cancellation. I didn't see at the time of booking that the hotel has a no cancellation policy. What? Why do you need to charge me for a room that I'm not going to stay in two months down the road and you know you are going to re-book the room to some other unknowing person? Doesn't make sense.

I sent them an email asking if they would waive the fees if I requested a cancellation. The next day I woke up to a debit from my bank account for this hotel in the amount of $222.33. This does not include the non sufficient funds fee of $34. Are you guys serious? Why would you charge me and I asked a question? I received no response yet but you charge me anyway. Where in America is this type of scam acceptable behavior. I contacted reservations. She blamed the fee in Booking.com. I called Booking.com she called the hotel and they declined to waive the fee stating they have a strict policy. She advised me to call the Front Desk and ask for a manager. The rude female hurried up and told me there are no managers on duty and to call back tomorrow between 8-4 and ask for Maurice. I spoke to 3 people for absolutely nothing. Everyone passed the buck and no one took ownership. As a supervisor of Customer Service at my job I cannot pass the buck. I have to take ownership.

I will continue to call until I have a resolution including corporate. I have advised anyone I know do not book at this hotel. It is disgusting and unclean and their staff are just as bad. They do not care about the consumer and are passing the buck. It makes no sense that I called the hotel twice and no one would take ownership of the situation.

This time was a real let-down and I sincerely hope it was just a glitch because you couldn't ask for a more beautiful setting for a hotel.  Tucson Mountain Park is across from it and offers nice trails that are easily managed with sneakers.  The resort grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. The employees are pleasant and friendly.  I'm happy to say that the outdoor patio with gas fire pits was every bit as wonderful as the first two times - there is no nicer spot to enjoy the moon and stars and twinkling valley lights that I can think of.     

Now on to the bad news.  When we checked in I asked for a room with a balcony that had an open railing (vs. the masonry closures that block part of the view) - we were told there aren't any of those at the resort (I thought I remembered them from previous visits but she insisted that there weren't any).  After unpacking all our stuff, I went out for a walk around the hotel and saw that there were dozens of rooms with the open type of railing and chairs on the balcony, just as I requested.  When I went back to the desk to ask about it they offered to move us to one of those rooms but I really wasn't up to repacking and moving and unpacking again so we didn't bother.  It was disappointing and irritating, to say the least.  

As it happened, we should have repacked and moved.  Our room had the odor of stale cigarette smoke coming through the HVAC - completely unacceptable, especially for a Marriott property.  We turned off the HVAC and one night even slept with the slider door open to try to alleviate it.  Ridiculous and ultimately useless - we ended up leaving a night earlier than our reservation.

There is a fabulous restaurant on the premises called Primo that we've enjoyed previously and we were eager to eat there again.  The restaurant info was prominently displayed by the elevator to our room.  So we went the first night.  It was closed.  The next day we called the front desk to ask if it would be open and were told it would.  So we went again.  It was closed.  Really unprofessional for a resort of this ilk and well below the Marriott brand (especially JW).  The good news is that the concierge recommended Maynard's Kitchen in downtown Tucson (see my review) which was just outstanding and we were thrilled to discover it.

Our treatment was particularly egregious because we were with a wedding party that had a block of 65 rooms and arranged a private brunch for over 100 people, spending a substantial amount of money at the hotel.
 
First, before returning to the hotel after the wedding, the family of the bride called ahead to ensure that the bar would remain open for the guests to gather.  Despite assurances that it would, the bar was shut down shortly after everyone arrived, and the head of security unceremoniously kicked everyone out of the bar and then the lobby.  While we understood that a bar has the right to set its business hours and make poor business decisions, guests had traveled from around the country to spend time together, so the gathering moved to the guest rooms.
 
Shortly thereafter, a few guests picked up alcohol to bring to the guest rooms, but were prevented from doing so by the head of security.  Indeed, the head of security even searched some guests' bags to determine whether there was alcohol in them, which he had no right to do.  I want to be perfectly clear - these were adults, well over the legal drinking age, who had rooms in the hotel, and who were not behaving rudely or in an intoxicated manner.  Further, we were explicitly told that there had been no noise complaints in the hotel. 
 
Despite our repeated requests, we were never given a straight answer as to why we could not bring the alcohol to our guest rooms (and actually, another member of the security team acknowledge that this was inappropriate).  Instead, the manager called the police and physically barred us from returning to our guest rooms.  I'm told the police arrived later and immediately left because the call was ridiculous.  Meanwhile, the receptionist was literally screaming at the father of groom.  I was unable to ascertain exactly what she was saying, but it was extremely unprofessional and uncalled for, particularly because he was speaking reasonably with her and the other hotel employees.

Internet worked well, but was $15 a day.  TV is newer, but room lacked mini-bars.  Street noise can be heard in some rooms. Front desk was understaffed at check-in.  Service is friendly and room service was prompt, but it would be hard to choose this hotel on a non-business trip.  Being very large and centrally located is great and is has a lot of amenities, but is a pretty typical super-sized Marriott. Lots nearby. 

Tip: If you can swing it, do the Four Seasons or Ritz nearby.",2012-03-06 05:46:50

I booked this hotel a month and a half ago for a stay for the AERA conference. At a steep $205 a night and with the Wyndham logo, I expected a pretty nice hotel, especially for the area.

Oh god, what a disappointment. Let's recap my two night stay, shall we?

1) Checked in. Despite my reservation explicitly stating a king bed rather than two queens (my boyfriend was originally coming with) and asking to stay in a room away from the elevators, my room had dos queen beds and I fell asleep both nights to the sweet serenade of elevator pings and drunk people wandering to their rooms.

2) I ordered breakfast with that lovely service on the doorknob you leave out the night before. I asked for the following: a small pot of coffee, oatmeal, and sliced melon, for 8:15 am. Come 9:15 am, I still haven't received any food. I call the room service line, and receive that they're ""behind"" and it should be up shortly. I get my breakfast comped (which later was not actually comped on my bill), but they show up with my food sans fruit. Even after calling, they couldn't get my order right.

3) The noise. Sweet jesus, the noise. I heard every door slam, every toilet flush, every phone call in the rooms next door, and even the frigging headboard knocking in the room next to mine.

4) The filth. On my first night there, I had showered before I arrived, so I didn't use it that day. On the second day, I opened the shower curtain- keep in mind, housekeeping had come that day- and found the most vile looking shower. There were spots of brown on the wall, HAIR, and black and grey water spots all over. Boy's college apartments look cleaner than this.  
Once again, I had to call management and demand housekeeping come up before I could shower- at 9 pm. The rude maid came, and despite knowing I had complained, my shower was still dirty and stained when I went in after. I begrudgingly took my gross shower.

Even the sink faucets aren't lined up to the bowl so you can't wash your hands properly.

They comped me one night, but for this fiasco, I should have stayed free. I will NEVER go back and I damn well don't know if I'll stay at a Wyndham again. 

Shame on you, Wyndham.",2014-04-09 20:02:50

After this stay, my friend and I decided that we will not be returning after using this hotel for multiple visits.

This was not a particularly great stay. I'm usually pretty lenient on hotels for whatever reason, but I had to say something about this. The quality has gone downhill while the aesthetics have gotten better. You used to have mini-fridges in the room. No longer. All of the electronics were unplugged in our room when we got in, so that was fun to have to go around and do that first thing. Want HBO? They've got it. Well, sort of. Just HBO Boxing, you know, everyone's favorite HBO channel. Movie rentals are almost $20. There was some dried blood on the shower curtain and water stains on the lampshades. 2 sheets of notepaper on the complimentary pad. The issue was just a lot of different little inconveniences and frustrations and just lack of effort, like no one was really trying or paying attention. Not cool for a hotel room that costs $230. 

And the restaurant. Oh god. Do not eat there. Especially when there are SO MANY amazing restaurants literally only 5 minutes away by foot. We dined in the hotel restaurant for some inexplicable reason which I wish we could take back. Horrific service. We saw our waiter twice in 90 minutes and the greeter/person who seated us was rude and vanished, never again to be seen. It took 90 minutes to get a cheesesteak missing the cheese (how can you forget an ingredient that's in the name??) and we were only ever able to get one drink because there was no one around and when they were, would ignore us when we waved or tried to catch their eye. Yuck. Do not eat their food or spend your money there! 

The only real bonus of this hotel is its location. Like...you just cannot beat the location. Until someone else opens up there this is your best option if you want to be right in the middle - literally - of history and the city. With its prime spot, Wyndham has an opportunity to do well it feels like they're cutting corners and dropping the ball on details that should be effortless. No one looked happy to be working there. I saw another review of this same hotel written 3 months ago that mentioned validated parking and in-room microwaves and fridges, and I'm really confused by this. We were told over and over (and there's a sign saying) that parking is $35 a day plus taxes, so this assertion of complimentary parking is strange. It is NOT free. And there were no fridges or microwaves to be seen. So, I'm not really sure what's going on with the hotel...",2017-09-25 00:23:33

The parking situation is pretty bad - there's a crappy lot at the bottom of the hill the hotel is on to park in that is $5 each time you leave. Not terrible, but that's the first thing you encounter unless you do the $10 valet parking. Which is worth mentioning because valets will be bolting down the sidewalk with keys and then (seriously) nearly running you over in their rush to get people their cars asap on the way back. It's a curved road up the hill and they must hit 45. We saw a couple racing to see who could get their car up first.

But annnyway. You arrive at the front desk (after trying not to go into the first Hilton entrance you see, as this is a fine looking hotel with a courteous service desk. But you're not staying here. You're staying at the City Avenue. You poor, poor sap). The front desk will exasperatedly wave you over, ask for your name and a credit card and give you a key. They likely won't tell you what room you're in before asking for the next person, but the information is written on the card they've handed you. Try not to interact with them again.

There are only 2 (pretty slow) elevators for the hotel, so it might take a while, but eventually one will arrive to take you up to your floor. Once you get in your room, you will likely be pleasantly surprised with how nice it is in comparison with everything you've experienced up until now. And during the day it is quite nice! But whoever did their renovations neglected soundproofing, and the materials the've used in the hallways, combined with the 1 inch gaps under your door mean that you will hear EVERYTHING that goes on on you floor. Every person that gets of the elevator, every time a door opens or slams, every hot drunken mess that staggers down the hallway loudly looking to find their room. Plus some VERY loud random sounds (possibly from the plumbing???) that would wake the dead on their own.

But at least you're rewarded for staying out all day by both not needing to be there and not needing to pay another $5 to leave, so enjoy your time out and see the city, because hopefully that's what you're here for. If you DO find yourself in this hotel and are looking up reviews to see if your experience is just some Kafkaesque abberation, just remember not to let your hotel ruin the rest of your stay, because, even if a Red Roof Inn would have been an improvement, in the end you can't let this place win.

It's a Wyndham, which I guess is a Holiday Inn brand, but with less customer service and higher prices.

When we got there, this had changed - they have a crappy bar/restaurant that literally charges $8 for pancakes and even $4 for cereal. There were no food vouchers, no apologies for the change, just snotty replies about how I should read more carefully when I book a hotel! And the same thing happened with the beds - I booked one queen size and instead got two doubles. There was not even an offer to check if there was a queen available.

Upon check in we entered the room only to find used soap and shampoo containers in the bathroom.  We called the front desk and they were going to fix it right away.   We got dressed to go see the city.  In our room on the floor we found another nice surprise. An empty box of condoms.  Now I'm worried about what else wasn't cleaned.  I put it next to the shampoo so the staff would take it.  We headed out for the day and on our way to the elevator we ran into the staff going to our room.

So we scoot around Philly all day long, get back and nothing is corrected despite running into staff just feet outside our door who said he was going into our room.

The sheets, shower, etc...  So now the problem is fixed.  My wife and I climb into bed for a romantic evening.  About an hour later we get a knock at the door.  We choose to ignore it because of our attire.  The knock continues.  Five KnUocks over 2 minutes.  I go to the door and see it is security through the peep. I said I couldn't answer the door and to go away or call.  This is no exaggeration. He rudely demanded that I open the door immediately and showed me a universal card key machine.  I didn't want my wife busted in on so I opened the door in my underwear.  He said he needed to do lock work since I reported someone in my room.  I explained that I hadn't reported that and in my underwear he made me reexplain.  I got frustrated to him to go away and leave me alone, locked the door with chain and went back to bed.

The fire alarm goes off and says to go to the stairs and evacuate.  Okay I like fire alarms to work, but here is the failing.  Someone comes on the PA and says they are investigating the alarm.  People are emptying out my floor.  I called the front desk & they had no info at all.  So we throw on clothes, and walk down 14 flights of stairs at 4am. Once outside the fire dept is there.  Certainly there is hotel staff with an update right? Wrong.  No one to be found.  So do you go into a potentially burning hotel to figure out the problem.  After a good wait that is exactly what I did.  The staff again very casually expressed that it was false, someone played with the extinguisher.  The fire dept was there by alarm.  There never was another pa announcement until someone else told the manager you should make an anouncement and I said you have people waiting outside. We went back to our room climbed into bed shut our eyes and then guess what.... That's right the security anouncement!  Just to wake you again.  Even with a potential free room, I'd chose a different spot.  The location is great though.  By the way, it was a 2 night stay.",2011-10-16 09:16:58

- When we checked in (early check in at 10am), valet was full.  There were a few events at the hotel that morning, so not only could we not park at the hotel, but all other nearby parking facilities were also full.  Most hotels do put aside a share of their parking to ensure overnight guests are accommodated, but since we were an early check in, I can't fully fault the hotel.  However...

- Some of the valet staff was downright rude.  Rather than shouting at incoming guests, why don't you try to politely tell them what you want to do.  It isn't my fault that your parking was full and everyone is trying to scramble.  To their credit, other staff were all quite friendly.

- It was in the mid 90's on the day we stayed, and the A/C for the whole hotel broke in the evening.  Now, these things happen from time to time.  But the lobby had gotten so hot that the starbucks pulled all their food because it was all melting.  They did eventually fix, and overnight the temperature came down.  Like I said, these things do happen ,but...

All together, this is an adequate hotel that may be a little too big for its staff to effectively manage, and that needs to be updated but probably won't be any time soon since downtown Philadelphia has a shortage of hotel rooms so they don't need to.",2016-09-12 14:53:09

There is a lot to say about my stay at this location! I travel all over the US, 35 states and counting, and many fall short but not here. I'm greeted by friendly staff who go over every detail to make sure your stay is enjoyable. Lets just say, if my company ever decided to move me somewhere else, I would have complained to high heaven. My room was the bomb and the service matched the attitude of the facility. Even the maids, who looked liked they worked the hotel for fun, made sure every detail was covered in my room. The pool was kept to a perfect temperature and I was able to do laps while its was pouring snow outside. The fire-pit was operated by a timer...Plus Plus...There were cameras at every exit which gave me a sense of safety. They had some repairs to do when I arrived and they were major but they fixed all of that in days...when was the last time you saw that? Hats off...The staff was what did it for me. The breakfast crew went even further to make sure your morning started off right. They made it easy for me to drop cash on the table because they know how to take care of people. Everyone greeted me on entry and exit...That's key! The manager is the real deal here! She also serves at the bar, while watching over the entire operation...win win..When it looked like we were snowed in, they bust out with movie night and free pizza and it wasn't cheap pizza. The fireplace in the lobby stayed lit and I could always get warmed up down there. The internet worked great and thats another star..The shuttle drivers they had were very kind even when having to deal with rude people.

We are not rowdy girls; we didn't even order drinks other than water. Our meal went really well in the beginning! Our waitress (we believe her name was Megan) asked if we wanted anything other than water and got us started with the hummus and pita appetizer, which was delicious. She even brought us extra pita after we finished what was originally on the plate. She took our meal orders, brought it out, and then the problems started. She just ignored us the entire time we were eating and for 40 minutes or so after we'd already finished eating. 

Essentially, our waitress thought it would be cool to hang out with the table next to ours. She appeared there with a baby (??) and just talked to them for a good 20+ minutes while we stared at her. We initially wanted dessert, but after waiting for so long we gave up on it. Her back was to another one of her tables while she was chatting up the one table, too. She eventually walked away, gossiped with a male waiter, and then HE came over and asked if we needed anything. We asked for the check, which he walked away to get. In the meantime, our waitress walked by and heard us say ""I guess she passed us off to someone else,"" so she asked if we needed anything. We said the check, she said ok, and she walked away again! She didn't acknowledge us again after that.

We received our check and, since we paid with a gift card, had to tell the waiter what we wanted to be the tip. It was awkward, so we told him $10 which was 15%. She definitely didn't deserve that $10 - and trust me, I am always happy to give far more than 20-25% when I go out. 

It gets worse. We passed by the lady who appeared to be the manager of the restaurant (Adele?). When we told her what happened, she started laughing (?!!!) and said that we should have told her earlier and she would have comped us for something. Ummmm. No. Not a good enough solution. Sorry, but no. Pretty sure she didn't even apologize (but I could be wrong on that one).

We ended up telling the front desk, and they gave us the card of Adele's manager so we could reach out. They will be receiving a phone call and/or email from one of us soon if they haven't already.",2016-06-17 18:11:30

The Marriott in my opinion is worth it's tag price. The location is killer and in the heart of Old Town. We were five blocks from Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, one block from the infamous LOVE statue and Philadelphia town hall, and if you're feeling really walking spontaneous, a whopping nine blocks from the Museum of Art, with plenty to take in a long the walk. 

The Valet is overpriced, but we were happy with the service when we had to call for our car to get things we had forgotten right after we checked in. Most of the Valets were friendly and we were usually asked multiple times if we needed help instead of being ignored. It was nice to have the taxi cue in front instead of having to call for one. 

The Front desk is of a cold demeanor. Just ignore them. They don't want to be there and there's no changing their mind even if you get upset or get an attitude. It's honestly not going to do any good with these unhelpful species. 

The rooms are nice and in no way outdated. 

*The bed was comfy.
*The sheets were clean.
*There were towels.
*All amenities were present. 
*The TV worked
*The Hotel had wifi, but for a price. (Bummer)
*There were VGA hookups in the room, so you could hook up your laptop to the telly. (Netflix anyone?)

The shower was a bit like taking a shower underneath a watering can, but it got us clean.

1. Racist receptionist guy
So, we had reserved our 5 rooms months in advance. We had also called and informed that 5 of us were traveling together and would like our rooms next to each other. I was told that they can accommodate that. 

When we arrived, all 5 of us gave our driver's licenses and credit cards.. Somehow, all my 4 white female friends ended up on the 8th floor side by side of each other and I was the only one given a room on the 2nd floor. 
How come? 
A. We told 2 months prior that we wanted to stay together and they said it was ok
B. I was the second person to hand my card and license. If he the receptionist gave me the only room that's not even on the same floor because I was the last to hand it in and only 4 rooms were available on 8th floor.. Makes sense. But no, that's not what happened. He selectively decided to give ME the only room that's away from others. 
When I questioned, he said, take the room or go to a different hotel! Can you believe this? 
Since all our rooms had 2 beds, 2 of my friends got into a Same room and I got the room on the 8th floor. He didn't budge the whole time and didn't even say sorry. 

2. Good decor and comfortable 
If we look past the awful racist receptionist, the hotel is pretty good. Gym is okay, big lobby with nice furniture, good eatery on site. Rooms are clean and have all the essentials one may need. 

3. The view
Depending on the room you get, you will either have a nice view of the streets OR you will have the view of a Graveyard! So which side of the hallway your room matters greatly and I would've hated to look at graves every time I look through the window. Thank god mine had the street view.

Then when I asked for a valet personnel, he barely pointed at a valet personnel without looking at me or answering my question. 

Additionally, they forgot to order my room service and claimed there's no record of it, which I found out nearly 2 hours later because they would not pick up the phone before then.

This was especially prevalent at the front desk when a female worker was very rude and condescending towards me when I was just trying to purchase snacks. I lost my appetite once her behavior made it clear that she had no intention of helping me and would blatantly ignore me when I asked any questions. I could tell her rude behavior was only directed towards me however as she happily helped other guests and conversed with passing co-workers with a smile. Making me question if her behavior was an aggressive attack towards my age or race.  

The other problem I did come across was the cleanliness. It seemed that not all the towels were refreshed when I first came into the hotel. I noticed some makeup products on a washcloth and many stains on the floor. Overall was happy with my stay here but definitely, think they could work on cleanliness and customer service.",2017-10-14 17:17:23

So, when it came to my wedding weekend (pre-honeymoon) - I booked 3 days here while my family stayed at my house.  It is conveniently located around the corner from my house, and although I thought $155/night was a little steep, I went for it.  On Friday, I entered the room (outside entrance, ala motor lodge) and immediately stopped at the front door - the tile looked as though mud had been tracked all across it and I thought they had accidentally sold me a dirty room.  Got down on my hands and knees - nope, no dirt, just really ugly tile.  Hope they got a good deal on it.  Ok.  Get my computer set up - oh, neat - no outlet by the desk.  That's ok, I just fished behind the mini fridge for the power strip - had to unplug a lamp, but I did get the internet hooked up (after I paid the 5.95 fee - which I am accustomed to, but usually in much nicer places).  Ok.  Time to shower.  Holes in my towels when I went to dry off.  Classy.  Operator was rude when I called for a shuttle from the airport for my guest.

In the morning.  Breakfast at the Cactus Rose.  Mediocre.  Server apparently not accustomed with patrons not ordering off the menu (there is a buffet).  Looked at my companion strangely when she asked for a silverware set-up.  Never could find him to get a to-go container, so just took my half-eaten burrito back to the room (was hoping my other friend would want it when she woke up).  Well, she left it there (since there was no microwave to heat it up) and there it stayed for the next two days - housekeeping never did remove it.  Now, I DO leave tips for housekeeping staff, but it did not seem to matter.

Wedding night.  Returned to hotel.  Only one towel present in room (but it did not have any holes, so that was good).

This hotel was a huge disappointment.  I was embarrassed that I suggested it to my out of town guests, several of which stayed there as well.

On a side note, we honeymooned in Bisbee and stayed at Letson Lofts FOR THE SAME PRICE and had a 5 STAR experience...",2010-02-28 05:32:50

I took my fiancé there for her birthday with the kids, it was supposed to be a perfect getaway for us and the kids. I had called ahead to book my room and talked with the front desk, upon arrival I went to the front desk to check and I got this rude lady that didn't want to give me my room key, she said I would have to get a different room and that it would cheaper but I wouldn't get everything in the original package I got. I refused and wanted the correct room with my complementary breakfast, after hassling with her for about 30 minutes, she finally gave me my room key, with an ignorant look on her face. We got to the room thinking everything was al settled. We get to the hallway leading to our room and it was dreadful, they were doing renovating or something, nasty mattresses were in the hallway and microwave and our room was ALL THE WAY IN THE BACK, we open the door and it was the most disgusting room ever. There were stains on the wall, bugs flying around I swear there was a stain that looked like blood on the wall as well. We called the front desk demanding a new room and they said they were gonna send someone up and we waited. About 45 minutes later no one was sent up, so we took matters into our own hand and went to the front desk and demanded a new room. After hassling once more, we finally got a room with a good view and no stains or bugs. After about an hour we put our bathing suits on and went down to the pool, after swimming we went to the patio and sat down to eat at the ""Salud"" restaurant. After sitting down and waiting to get served , our waiter comes back with some work uniforms and stated that we cannot wear bathing suits in the restaurant, we were clearly outside in the patio eating, which is part of the pool area and not single sign stated no bathing suits. We Decided to go to room and change and then we came back down. Tell me why a whole family in bathing suits was eating perfectly unbothered, they had kids and the adults were wearing bikinis. We waited for the waiter to speak to them as well about the policy and nothing was said! When the food arrived we spoke to the waiter as to why we were singled out for wearing bathing suits when a couple tables over a whole family was clearly not dress properly. He stated his boss made him enforce the policy and would go speak with the family, we kindly asked him not too and demanded an explanation as to why nothing was said to them when they first arrived. He looked like a total deer in headlights, soon after he got his boss out there and he apologized for the inconvenience and said he would work with us in getting our money back and that he feels bad about the situation. We didn't care about the money but we felt totally attacked, as to why we were kicked out for wearing bathing suits when other families were not. A couple minutes later, the waiter comes back crying to us apologizing for the whole situation and said he would get our room paid for, and tab taken care of. He was straight up crying, I had to put everything aside and hug him in front of everyone and hoped he wouldn't let it affect the rest of his day, after a couple hugging sessions we finally left and I was in total shock of all the unprofessional staff working here. We are a Hispanic family as well and later that evening they waiter comes back with a churro to apologize, out of all the deserts on the menu he decided a churro, it's probably an overstatement, but all the flames just began to rise again. For almost $300 to stay at that resort we stand a majority of our stay fighting with the staff over unprofessional behavior and a disgusting hotel room. We were promised a full refund on our room and have yet to even receive it, we've contacted them several times and  no action is being taken, there is no communication what so ever. I would not recommend this hotel at all. I will never return and absolutely gave me the wrong first impression!",2018-08-03 04:44:52

The cleaning staff left a dirty, crusty wash cloth on the nightstand touching my personal belongings.  They also left a used, dirty sponge with hair (short curly black hair, was it a pub?) on it on our bathroom counter.  We also found a ROTTEN BANANA UNDER THE BED.  We took all of these items (banana, dirty wash cloth and sponge to the front desk).  While we ended up receiving a credit for 1 of our nights (and was told the general manager would be informed), I am still really disappointed such incidents even occurred. Such service should not be an issue when you are paying the rates to stay at a Wyndham.

Additionally, while parts of the hotel have recently been updated, the rooms have not.  Our facet leaked all over the bathroom counter, so any time you washed your hands/turned the water on, the counter got soaked.  Our TV never worked and our AC also worked poorly.  We also brought this to the attention of the front desk and the first person we spoke to was exceptionally rude.  I would NOT stay at this hotel again.

Mohammed (night shift) I told him that the rooms advertised two queens and it was two fulls. He seemed agitated already and told me that if we pushed the two full beds together that it would make a queen. Not only is that not scientifically possible but I was baffled by the suggestion. I understand that you don't need a diploma to work at the Hilton but this is common sense. I remained polite and asked for a cot to be brought up, he said we have no cots. I said okay can I get some extra pillows at least and he said you can't have five people to a room??? We only had four total. He was just insulting me at this point. I told him he was very hard to speak to and ended up walking away since I felt myself getting upset. If you don't like your job, don't work there.

We were supposed to only stay 2 nights, but ended up staying 4 because of what a wonderful place this is. We booked adjoining rooms so the kiddos can have their space while we have ours. 

The lazy river was really cool. I didn't really ever see the waterslide up and running, but I never asked either. Even the kids just wanted to relax. The Signature Club restaurant is great! A meal runs between $30-40, but the food is great and the kids ate for free, so it evened out. Our tabs are normally over $100 anyway when eating at a restaurant for 5, so given the quality of food, this was quite the deal, in my opinion. The patio of the restaurant overlooks the pool and you can see city lights in the distance, so it can be romantic as well. Dress is casual (we went after going in the pool and drying off). 

We didn't try the Primo restaurant, as it seemed fancier and the kids don't eat free there...lol. Our room was on the 2nd floor. The lobby is on the 3rd floor. Restaurants are on the 2nd floor as well. Given the fact that we were in the pool quite a bit, we should have requested a 1st floor room. Our room was nice (#2217 & #2219), but the bathroom door to room 2217 was essentially off hinge. It took extra muscle to open and close the door. We didn't complain since it was just the wife and me in the room and we could close our adjoining door to the kids' room. We'll let them know once we leave so hopefully it'll be fixed by the time the next guest arrives. 

Our rooms overlooked the lazy river. The pools are right next to each other, so it wasn't an issue to bounce back and forth. at one point, we had one of the pools to ourselves so the kids ended up playing with water cannons. My point to that is simply that there is PLENTY of room to spread out among the pools. 

Anyway, I don't know what else to say other than you won't be disappointed! If so, I'm sorry you had a different experience than we did. Being from Mesa, we'll definitely be returning to this resort again. Nothing but great things!

We were checked into this hotel on 12/21 (4 days before Christmas).  We gave Shane at the front desk our credit card to charge the room.  I reserved the room with my ATM card.

Next morning I noted TWO separate holds for $586.06 on my bank account from IHG; yup they locked up over $1,100 on my ATM card right before Christmas.  We drove over 1,200 miles to visit family and we can't spend that money on food or gifts; what a gift from IHG!

Remember they were supposed to charge the room to the credit card we gave them. 

So on 12/22 I spoke with Megan at the front desk. She removes one hold for $586 once I tell her to put the room on the credit card.  But Megan says she can't remove the second hold and it must be a mistake at my bank so I should call them; 3 days before Christmas.

I try to call bank, get cut off twice and on hold 20 mins then cut off. I give up and go down to front desk where I meet the Front Desk Manager, John Howarth.  John listens to the story and says there must be a problem with my bank.  I ask him to call Accounting at IHG and find out. He says no it's my bank. 

Well, the liars have been exposed this morning once I reach BOA and they say that only IHG can remove the hold that IHG places.  The Rep from BOA says that IHG should have been contacted by the hotel and they could have removed the hold so we could use the money for Christmas.

What IHG and this hotel did to me and my family borders on fraud and was mean and unprofessional.  Do you guys have $600 laying around? How would you feel if they held $600 from you just before Christmas when you needed it. 

It's 12/27 today and we checked out but that hold from IHG is still on my $586 and I can't use the money.  IHG will not assist and just keep passing the buck.  We should sue them to teach them a lesson.

I grew up in Tempe, went to NAU and had so many of my friends went to the UofA, so it was wonderful seeing another side of Tuscon. We live in Orange County and our middle son is a Sophomore at the UofA. Last year I was unable to get a hotel so I made a reservation at Starr Pass a year in advance. I do not normally make our travel reservations because my husband travels for business and he does this for us. During that year my e-mail shut down and my BofA Debit card, which I used to make my reservation, was compromised a countless amount of times so I did not have a confirmation number or credit card to look up my reservation. I called Starr Pass to explain my situation and confirm my reservation which is where my nightmare began!! Who knew?! AND, AT NO POINT DID ANYONE, INCLUDING A MANAGER ON DUTY, MAKE MY SITUATION ANY EASIER FOR ME! I explained three times my e-mail was down and was told all three times to bring my confirmation number with me when I checked in. I gave up. My husband and I travel a lot! My husband travels for work and stays in Marriotts as a Gold Elite member. We both love Marriott hotels and until now have never had any problems communicating our needs. After many calls and speaking with many different employees I was finally able to confirm my reservation. Thank God! I then explain that I needed to put my reservation on my husbands credit card and Gold Elite membership. My husband was traveling to Australia on business so I would be going to Family weekend by myself. I am told that they were unable to do either requests for me. My husband then has to call and they agree. I call back..AGAIN! I am told I need to fax my authorization form to her right right away. I do not have a fax machine, along with most of America in 2018, so I e-mail her the form immediately asking her in e-mail to confirm that she received it. I check my e-mail before my drive from Orange County to Tuscon but do not hear back from her. I check my e-mail twice on the drive and leave a message on her voice mail but still do not hear from her. When I check in on Friday, October 5, 2018, I am told they do not have my authorization form and the women at the desk tells me they can not use my hard copy or take my husband's Marriott Gold Elite card because he is not traveling with me. I ask to speak to a manager and FINALLY A COMPETENT EMPLOYEE! The manager checks me in, takes my husbands credit card and Marriott Gold Elite card. My husband sends me a text stating that his card was charged for two nights stay. When I checked in I told the women at the desk I would like to stay a third night, on Sunday night which I also put in writing on my hard copy authorization form and in the e-mail I sent that was never returned. After getting my husband's text I called the front desk and tell the women I would like to stay on Sunday night. I ask what the rate is and she gives me the same rate as Friday and Saturday night. I ask her why the rate is the same and she tells me that it is because it is UofA's Family weekend and that is their Family Weekend rate. I tell her that Sunday night is not included in Family weekend because when I checked in and the women at the front desk told me that all the families leave on Sunday and it would be very quite for me Sunday night and Monday morning. I also tell her that I was on the Starr Pass web site and their web site rate is much less then what she is quoting me. She tells me there rates have never ever been that low so I tell her to look on the Starr Pass web site, which she does, and then, and only then, does she tell me that she will honor the lower rate. WHAT? Thanks? I guess? I get off the phone with her and get another call from the desk saying I need to come and get my new keys since I am staying an additional night. I tell her I am about to leave for the UofA game and don't have time and shouldn't need new keys since I was staying in the same room, it was Saturday and if they were going to change my keys they could do so Sunday. She is so rude to me that I ask to speak to a manager. She is the manager. I have had it! I ask to speak to her manager, who ends up being the same gentlemen who helped me when I checked in. I tell him how upset I am and he tells me to go enjoy the game and he will check in with me the next day. I never hear from him. I stay three nights and never once get my room cleaned, not once, ordered room service, ate and drank at the bar and restauran,t and valeted my car (tipping each time I came and went). I HAD THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD AFTER SPENDING THAT MUCH MONEY! I WILL NEVER STAY AT THE STAR PASS AGAIN! EVER! I would recommend anyone and everyone finding another place to stay as well.

So we waited at the lobby. We went to Reading Terminal Market for lunch, came back and waited again. My husband went to check but nothing was ready so we waited in the lobby again. While waiting I became friends with a lady who was there for a conference. We got to talking and this was past 3 pm. She was very surprised that we are Platinum Elite members and were made to wait this long. Frustrated my husband went to check again. This time it was someone else at the Elite desk and she told us, ""oh your room has already been ready for more than an hour. Have you not been called?"" We were extremely taken aback as they could see us waiting with a fussy baby right in their lobby and no one bothered to let us know. We didn't receive a single apology.

Upon entering the room we found the wall bordering the elevator shaft, and every time the elevator moved, it was like a freight train passing by. My husband called the front desk and requested a room change, he was told that there were no rooms available and that they would move us the next day. Needless to say no one called the next day and when my husband called to check he was told that a manager would call him back. No one called.

Around 11 am, there was a really loud knock, I answered asking who is there, two more loud knocks and someone just opens our room, enters, turns the lights on and leaves. I thought that was extremely rude, and a huge violation of our privacy, since we had a Do Not Disturb Sign right on the door. I called front desk to let them know what happened. The lady who answered was really nice and apologetic and told me that shouldn't have happened. She wanted me to speak to the housekeeping manager.

I had some concerns about the cleaning. There was a comb left behind and some grungy corners in the bathroom. The room itself (as do probably half the rooms) overlooked a bunch of rooftop air conditioning units that droned loudly all night. The breakfast bar was mediocre, uninspired, and pretty expensive ($18 before tax and tip). The meeting rooms were typical in size and finish, but seemed poorly kept up. There were multiple carpet snags and miscellaneous debris that remained over the 3 days. Some employees were friendly and helpful (especially check in), but others were grumpy and almost surly.

The first encounter with the front desk attendant was not pleasant. He was unfriendly and unaccomodating. The room he gave my friend and me was the worst one in the hotel. He told us the hotel was booked except for six rooms. My friend told him she wanted a room with a view, and he claimed it had the better of the six. We found out that was not the case. In addition we valet parked bc it was late and we were tired due to delayed flights and all day travel.  The valet was gracious enough to charge us half price for parking bc of this. When we told the clerk this, he kept repeating ""it's $20 numerous times."" Then he decides to go talk to the valet, either for confirmation or to scold him. It doesn't matter what he did but he had the temerity to leave us standing at the front desk after we made it clear we were tired. He comes back and confirms $10 and charges us $10 per day for the whole stay. We just wanted to pay for one night so I told him that and he says with an attitude, you need to be clear about what you want. I said how about not assuming and confirming what we want!  After we finished with him, we finally went to our room. 

Room
The room overall was underwhelming. It overlooked the valet parking lot. And I expected  the rooms to be more lavish than they were since it was a resort, but it looks like a motel 6 room. The furniture was dated and looked worn. It looks like they spent more time on the bathroom, bc overall, that was nice. It had a soaking tub and separate shower. The wifi connection was choppy and a nuisance to connect to. We had to call their IT to help us connect bc it was not going through on our phones nor my computer. 

bathroom
The front of the sink was falling apart, I guess bc of water damage.  And the shower was not effective at keeping water from flooding the floor in front when you open the door after showering. So my friend and I had to load towels in front of the shower. 

Lastly, I want to discuss the treatment throughout our stay.  Both my friend and I are African American.  We felt like everyone was staring us down from staff to guests as if we were aliens wherever we walked on the property. It was like they never saw black people. It was uncomfortable the whole stay there and by the time check out came my friend had had enough and even berated a woman for staring.

He put our friend in the same room with my husband and I. We told him a couple times that he was in a separate room. He then told us that they didn't have any more rooms available. It was just after 4pm (which is check in time). Eventually they text him about an hour later telling him it was ready but on a different floor.

We all changed and headed down to the pool. They make you stop and check in/get bracelets before allowing you to go in the pool area. They even check your bags - I mean go through every little thing in your bag...our friend brought a small cooler with a few beers in it, not knowing it was going to be a problem. They told him to take it back up to the room which was a long walk from the pool! He asked if he could just bring it since it's usually not a problem at the other hotels we go to.

Good grief...they need to reevaluate who works for them. These people should not be in customer service of any kind! They were rude and did not make you feel valued what so ever. Drink orders would take forever and on top of that, ""last call"" was at 5:30pm! They either need more servers so they aren't so ""busy"" or just make people get out and walk to the bar since they can't seem to make time for everyone.

The front desk staff have a tendency to be rude and not care about your accommodations even when calling ahead of time and let's say asking for adjoining rooms or a crib. But the conditions of the hotel itself are daunting and to believe that Hilton as a brand is not on top of this, is quite unnerving. The cleanliness of the hotel is kept pretty poorly with peeling wall paper, mold in bathrooms, drops of strange substances around toilet and suite bar areas, clusters of dirt and debris culminated in corners of rooms, mysterious substances on the bedskirts of the beds, and stained dk brown carpet where you can't even be sure what you're walking on top of. This is not the worst of it folks, oh no there is more. I just came back from a weekend stay there and the I am disgusted and will never stay there with my family again. We got in late Friday and the minute we checked in and got off the elevator on our floor which was the 6th floor the smell of marijuana hit you like a ton of bricks. Because we were exhausted we just hoped our rooms wouldn't smell and we'd go to bed. We got into our rooms (mind you I was with a two and a 4 year old) and one of our rooms wreaked of smoke....this is supposed to be a non-smoking hotel. The air conditioner did not work in one room so we hoped by leaving the door in between our rooms open, we would get some cold air from the other room during our nights sleep. In the morning we woke up, ordered room service which was excellent actually. Also the valet service was excellent. Only two good things about it and one of the main housekeepers was incredibly nice and so was one of the bellhops we had to interact with the next night because....so we disappeared all day to visit family we have there and didn't come back to the hotel until 10:30. At that time, we walked in and our bedroom window was open. We thought perhaps the maid had left the window open because yet again there was an overwhelming smell of marijuana on our floor. Already sadly this was an indicator we wouldn't come here again along with the lack of cleanliness in the room. But then we noticed all the bugs that had flown in to the room. There were a lot. We decided we couldn't sleep there. We informed management. The housekeeper and a manager came up and at the time the manager looked at us and said ""oh well the bugs are here because they were attracted to the light. If you turn it off, they will go away."" Excuse me?!? No we weren't going to sleep with bugs for $200/night. We told him that there was no way this was acceptable and we didn't even leave the light or the window open! We didn't even know the windows could open. Finally we were moved to a suite which was all they had available. We needed double beds but there weren't any. My husband had to sleep on the sofa bed which everyone knows will be the worst sleep one can get and I slept with the two children in the king. I'll tell you the suite was in no better condition. Dirty, even an open safety pin was on the floor in the corner. A hair in the shower and it was not someone's head hair . Stains on carpet and bathroom floor. The toilet room light didn't work so you had to do your business with that door open to see. It was pretty bad. I kept telling my kids to wear socks if they were going to walk around and to not touch the carpet with their little hands. This hotel needs help. Corporate needs to know they need to change it up, upgrade the conditions it's currently in and find a way to better detect smoke. Oh by the way, the suite was on the 6th floor and that too smelled of marijuana and cigarette smoke combined! It was pretty overhwelming even in the mornings. Oh and I forgot to mention that my mother in law who stayed in the room adjoining us on the 6th floor reported that there were already new guests in the bug room and she didn't hear anyone in the middle of the night change sheets or clean the room. Which potentially means the new guests would be in the room we had vacated as it was with the bed sheets we used. Frankly we don't even know if we slept in clean sheets either! Having said all of this we will never stay here again unless Hilton really makes an effort to renovate and change things around here.  I felt it was my duty as a mother and a concerned guest to warni anyone else about the poor conditions of this hotel as well.",2019-06-24 16:15:40

I travel often because I work for an airline and this hotel was one of the worst I've ever stayed at customer service wise. On arrival at PHL airport, I called the hotel to have the complimentary shuttle come pick me up at the international arrivals area. The lady who picked up my phone call was rude when at first I wasn't sure which terminal I was at because I've never been to Philadelphia before. After figuring it out and getting off the phone, I waited about 20 mins for the shuttle to arrive and the driver was very nice and had helped me with all of my luggage. We arrived at the hotel about 5 mins later and due to not having my credit card for the booking (I had accidentally left it with my boyfriend who was flying in two hours after me) I wasn't able to check in to a room despite having a reservation through booking.com. While understandable since that was hotel policy, my 6 month old son and I had just flew in from overseas on an 8 hour flight. The last thing I wanted to do was sit in the lobby of the hotel for two hours after such a long flight with an infant while I waited for my boyfriend to fly in and give them my card. I asked the lady at the front desk Tysha, if there was anything she could do to accommodate my baby and I while we waited and she seemed to not care at all. She showed zero empathy and severely lacked customer service skills. She just looked with her eyes towards the lobby and said ""I can't do anything, but we have a lobby."" As soon as I sat down at one of the tables, I noticed it was extremely hot. My son was sweating and red in the face as was I. I asked Tysha if their AC was broken in the hotel and she shook her head no and asked if I was hot. She then told me if I was hot to get up and stand under the air vent so I got up to do so, and felt nothing. 10 minutes later she came out from behind the desk and said that I was right and that it was hot in the lobby and only then she decided to call maintenance to report the issue. The AC was not fixed the entire time we were waiting in the lobby which was about 2 and a half hours. My son then needed to be changed so I took him to the restroom in the lobby, but it did NOT have a changing table so I had no choice but to change my baby on a mat on the floor of the lobby.  When my boyfriend landed, I called him to inform him of my situation and he immediately called the hotel to sort it out. When he was talking to Tysha on the phone, she was rolling her eyes and slammed the phone to hang up after the call was over. While it was my mistake that I didn't have a credit card on hand for the booking, it would have been nice for the staff to show some level of customer service skills and maybe suggest a place where I could change or breastfeed my baby or a place that we could wait that had working AC. I will NEVER stay here again or at another hotel by this company and will make sure everyone is aware of how poorly we were treated.",2019-05-05 01:48:11

There was, however, a large pile of clean towels on the bed, not sure how this was overlooked. I called down to the front desk, and 10 minutes later, when they picked up, they told me to leave them outside the room, and they would be picked up soon. Well, when I checked out at 4 pm the following day, they were still there, strange. 

The room temperature was easily adjustable and the bathroom water pressure and temperature and pressure were also perfect. 

As noted above, it was slightly hard to get ahold of the front desk. I might suggest taking the trip downstairs rather than waiting on hold. 

Being a Titanium member, I had access to the lounge, which has a more than impressive breakfast spread with an even more beautiful view. It's a nice touch, and the service is excellent. 

If you are taking an Uber or Lyft, please note that there are two entrances and make sure you have the right one! From personal experience, this can be tricky.

Our wedding was in the Phoenixville area for the weekend of August 17th, 2019 and we made reservations at this hotel for the wedding over a year ago. However, when our guests tried to make reservations there, they were told there was no rooms available for our wedding. Due to this, we decided to get different hotels which would serve our guests. We called on three separate occasions to cancel our reservations and the front desk stated there was nothing under our name. We stated that there should be because we made the reservations, but they reassured us that there were no rooms under our names and that we would NOT be charged anything. Three different times by Desmond hotel. 
Of course, the day before our wedding, MEREDITH, the hotel manager, calls us right before we are driving to our rehearsal dinner to see our family and friends, she states there are NINE rooms still under our name. We explained that we tried to cancel an was reassured there was nothing under our name. SHE COULDN'T CARE LESS. Actually she charged my credit card for $2,400 for unoccupied rooms on our wedding weekend and had my wife crying and in tears and she ended up just charging us and hanging up on us on August 16th, 2019. MEREDITH the hotel manager is an uncaring, unprofessional and we know we have been frauded by this hotel and company. We are currently taking this up with Corporate and will be getting a lawyer if needed. For a ""hotel manager"" to treat us like trash on our wedding weekend and have wife cry on the way to our rehearsal dinner and then just charge us $2,400 for rooms that aren't used that we tried to cancel, but couldn't because the hotel staff reassured us that we do not have any rooms. ALSO, we found out they spelled our name wrong and they stated they will still not refund us any money. So basically on what was supposed to be the best day of our lives, started us by getting frauded by this hotel and getting treated like trash and them stealing $2,400.00 from us.
I never write reviews... but this story had to be told and may go to the news about this because we are currently gathering phone records to prove everything. They do not care about anyone but themselves. I can honestly say this without a doubt.

We stayed over this past weekend and entered the hotel to this HUGE din of noise from very loud guests, many screaming in their cell phones in front of everyone. We could not hear each other speak. It was deafening. Somehow the culture of our country has become one of total self-involvement, never mind the people around you. 

When we checked out and were waiting for our party, a party of 10 came in to talk to another party--again boisterous and rude behavior and speaking. They were SO loud.

She did not appreciate the suggestion or the shocked look her co-worker gave her. She also took our credit card for incidentals and actually ran it for a strange amount then had to fix that error. It took her forever to get us checked in. Normally, this would not be a big deal, but she was just so rude about her ways.  I assumed this was just a bad apple. Nope, the next day we asked at check in if there was a concierge and this girl too was bothered by us. We asked if there was a map of the hiking trails or if she knew anything about them and she said there was not and didn't know.

HOTEL
This is a large hotel.  We did not take advantage of any of the amenities: the restaurant, bar, gym, Starbucks, gift shop, etc.   Although, I did notice that they were in use by many of the hotel's guests
  
The rooms were also nicely decorated, comfortable beds-- if you need a safe, make sure you request a room with a safe.  (Ours did not have one.)

STAFF
-Overall, I found the all of the staff members except one person for be helpful, warm and professional.  Prior to arriving, I had called to request an early check-in, and arrangements were made without issue.  Checking in and checking out was also a breeze.    The staff member who did not meet expectations was the woman who was working in the valet. I observed and felt that the woman who worked at the valet was extremely short--borderline rude with all hotel guests.  

PARKING
$48 per night... The valet is 24 hours.  Initially, $48 for a 1 night stay seemed a little steep; however, it appears parking is $$ in Philly due to the limited space.  The convenience of having a valet, and not worrying about tickets, tows, etc made it all worth it.",2013-09-26 01:14:30

The location was excellent since it was in Center City.  The hotel was fairly new and I liked the modern decor.  The hotel room itself was clean.  The front desk service was very friendly and helpful for check-in and luggage storage.  It was a really good deal for a new hotel.  The only complaint (why I wouldn't give 5 stars) was the 2nd floor restaurant since we had breakfast there.  The restaurant service was super slow and the staff seemed confused about where we could sit.  It took more than half hour for coffee refills and service in general.  The breakfast food was good but It was a bit frustrating dealing with the rude and slow service.  I would stay at this hotel again but I would skip the restaurant.,2021-04-12 15:44:14

I called to ask about rates before booking and was asked the same questions over and over again like what city and state the Starr Pass Resort was in... once the gentleman finally figured out what he was doing he put me on hold for a while which is fine but when he came back he told me they didn't have the government rate I was asking about, that he could book me in a hotel down the street for the government rate and that he wanted my email to book. 

I explained that I was calling about Starr Pass and that I wanted to stay there if possible. He tells me he will check availability and tells me it will be over 200 a night but there is only one room available and I need to give him my email to book right away...  I don't like the rush to book me when it doesn't even seem like he is listening to me or trying to help. Also my son made some noise in the background at one point during the call and he said, no kids are checking in right? in a very rude tone. I could understand if he needed to know but don't be a jerk about it. 

I was seriously unimpressed and ended up letting him know we were no longer interested in booking. Hopefully staying there is better than booking there.


Edited to add that 30 minutes later I get a call from the same guy I spoke to even though I did not provide my number asking for Walter to make changes to his reservation in Scottsdale. Good luck Walter!!!",2017-06-12 15:10:21

     However, the maid was quite rude when we happened to come by briefly while she was cleaning and the language barrier had nothing to do with that. The black out drapes in the bedroom were hung improperly, as we reported to staff, the  result being that landscape lighting outside the bedroom window shown like the sun all night long. One of the young men at the front desk tried to fix it and I applaud the effort but it didn't work. I had to pin them in place myself. The sofa in the living area was so old that the cushions were compacted and it was incredibly uncomfortable to sit on. We took the pillows off the bed and sat on those. The bed was also uncomfortable. There were at least two nights of our stay that I got no sleep whatsoever.The last night of our stay I noticed that it was more comfortable than it had been all week as if part of the padding had been increased although it could be that I was simply exhausted. 
   As far as the food service goes, it left much to be desired. I would go into that but I will just suggest that you have a ""secret manager"" eat there and you will understand.

At the time when we booked our reservation the Hotels.com booking page listed that check-in was 24-hours. This was a major part of our trip planning and helped us decide on this hotel instead of others in the area. We arrived at the hotel at 10:30am after driving 2 1/2 hours from New York. When I went to check in, the manager Michelle, who was at the front desk quickly and rudely let me know that check in was at 3pm. When I told her of the 24-hour check in advertised on Hotels.com she was extremely dismissive and refused to help us in any way or come to any compromise. I stepped out to inform my friends and when I came back to the front desk and there was another lady behind the counter. She was even worse than the manager. I let her know that the check in time was falsely advertised and that there had to be some way they could accommodate us at a sooner time. All I got was an attitude from this lady so I asked for Michelle again. I showed her the listed check-in time on the website and she told me I should've checked their website instead. My reply was that if a third party website like hotels.com is their main source of reservations then it's up to them to make sure that information is correct instead of me doubting it and having to check their website. I suggested that she have us on call in case a room were to open up sooner. She did not seem welcoming to the idea and assured me we would still have to wait until 3pm but I insisted they take my information and gave me a call in case. I understand it was a busy weekend but they should have prepared for such rather than the service suffering for their lack of effort. When we got back to the hotel around midnight after our event, none of our room keys worked. I reserved a suite for 3 people and paid extra for such and yet they only gave us 2 bath towels. They had no extra towels or blankets that night or the morning after. The continental breakfast was about the only good thing this hotel offered us. For next years festival I will make sure to stay at another hotel. The check-in time on Hotels.com has since been changed, I'm sure that was due to my complaining.",2015-09-10 06:09:10

Everything for the wedding was beautiful but the women serving our table at the reception really put a damper on the mood and made it awkward for my table and the parents table. Since I'm related to the bride, my table was all family as well as my parents table was all the older relatives. So this lady is serving the family tables. I'm not sure what her name was but she was an older server with white grey hair. Her name was maybe Donna or Debbie I'm not sure.

Everyone had a different experience with this lady. She was very rude and made weird comments about everything and sipping left over champagne from the bottles. She also scolded my uncle when he took a sip of champagne before the toast and then even refused to give my cousin a piece of wedding cake since he already had a brownie. The list goes on and on. 

One thing in particular she said to me that was absolutely MORTIFYING was when she came around with champagne. When she got to me I asked if I can have cider instead. This lady straight up asked me in front of the entire table ""What are you, PREGNANT??"" I was so shocked and mortified I didn't even know what to say. It made the mood so awkward and everyone couldn't enjoy their time at dinner because of her.

Honestly this lady got lucky I just wanted cider because I just don't like the taste of champagne. Can you imagine if I was pregnant and didn't want to tell my family?? Or if I just had a miscarriage or couldn't get pregnant?? This was a whole new level of rudeness that it's unheard of. Worst experience in service in my life and this was at the JW Marriott!!

snS_V8NTr3IL2yXggctmJw,3G4bIbV7S4EvzhhtqFApgw,EYoA7Zwg92rDj6pMAQQLTA,2,3,0,1,"I was very excited about my visit to the JW Marriott Star Pass resort in October. The resort and grounds are beautiful, but I should have read the TripAdvisor and Yelp reviews more carefully. This property has the potential to be one of America's most beloved resorts, but it falls flat in a few areas.

First, bear in mind I was there five nights and spent over $1,500 for my stay, so I have some experience with the property.

The good:
* The location is fantastic, especially if you want to be away from downtown traffic.
* Best access to Saguaro National Park West and the Desert Museum - both a must-see.
* As others have noted, the rooms could stand a little refreshing, but I enjoyed the rustic charm.
* The grounds and surrounding area are great, with wonderful views of Tucson at night and the saguaro cactus-covered hills surrounding the resort.
* They offer some unusual daily programs (Native American morning ceremony, the daily hike, and the sunset tequila toast are notable.)
* Complimentary laundry room for guest use, a nice feature to have after you have been hiking in the desert all week.
* Valet service runs $25 per day, is extremely convenient, and I had nothing but good experiences with their staff. My car was always waiting and ready to go, plus they have coolers full of bottled water to take with you on your desert adventures. Nice touch.
* The resort fee is $29 per day. With that, you have access to the various pools, Lazy River, the golf driving range at Star pass Golf Club, the well-stocked 24-hour gym, etc. I did try the Lazy River which was very enjoyable, but some features like the water slide were turned off because the hotel was empty during the week.
* The separately-run Hashami Spa located on the property is very nice, if expensive, and has its own outdoor pool, hot tub and cabana setup. Plus, Marriott/Bonvoy rewards members may use the indoor hot tub and steam room- both kept in excellent condition in the respective single-sex changing rooms by simply showing their room key. Unfortunately, they changed the closing hours from 7 pm to 5 pm while I was there, again, due to a lack of people staying at the resort.

The bad:
Unfortunately, this list ranges from minor inconveniences to completely dreadful.
* The free parking arrangement is ridiculous because the parking garage (good) is located all the way at the far side of the property (bad). If you forgot something in the car, it will be a half-hour roundtrip to retrieve it. 
Unfortunately, people that do not want to pay the valet charge but still want easy access to their car are encouraged to park on the narrow, winding road leading to the resort. Not a problem inbound, but you need to be very careful leaving the resort so that a door does not fly open or a small child dart out from between vehicles, because the cars are actually halfway into the roadway itself.
* Depending on when and where you eat at the resort, the food is just OK. 

Lastly, there is the service staff. This was the source of my highest dissatisfaction with the property. About half the hotel employees I came in came in contact with during my stay were great. The others? Well, Marriott desperately needs to hold some customer service training at this facility.
Millennials are the perennial target of customer dissatisfaction, but they have raised it to an art form here. I should mention that all hotel personnel with some grey hair or that were clearly born in another country were terrific. It was just that magical, entitled, American-born age group that I had issues with. From check-in to bar waitstaff, most of the American Millennials I dealt with were either disinterested, uninformed or flat-out rude.

When you check-in, they make a big deal about handing you your room key with both hands, with head slightly lowered- a cheapened facsimile of a Japanese business card exchange. I don't know whose idea in corporate marketing that was, but instead of putting so much effort into cultural appropriation that feels forced and artificial, their efforts would be much better spent convincing the Millennials to follow up on commitments and sticking to truthfulness. In a time where #metoo and #believewomen are the hallmarks of our national consciousness, I was lied to four different times the night I checked in by... women.

Finally, there was the bar staff member (another Millennial) that was so incredibly rude it practically ruined my stay. I did not get her name (my mistake) but from reading other reviews she is clearly a problem and continues to be employed despite her unprofessional behavior and having been reported to management numerous times.

Needless to say, I will never stay at this property again. The grounds are beautiful, and I love the location. However, the staff soured me on the whole Marriott experience. As a frequent traveler for work, I will be looking at offerings from other hotel chains for my hard-earned vacation plans.",2020-01-14 14:25:23

The hotels response to the incident has been by far the most disturbing aspect of my ordeal.

I reported the incident to the staff and the supervisor at the pool entrance was attentive to my concerns and assured me she would look into the situation. The authorities were called as the man was intoxicated and had exposed himself to other people near the pool as well. After this point the hotel didn't bother reaching out to me to confirm if I was safe or needed anything.

Thus, it's self-serve to a luggage cart at a large hotel trying navigate to your room. I would think that would be an issue for seniors and handicapped guests.

Notwithstanding some inconveniences, the hotel and restaurant staff was very pleasant and contributed to an enjoyable few days.",2020-10-30 00:12:20

So my bestie came in town for the weekend so I decided do a staycation so that we could enjoy the pool and play golf. Front desk, bell hops, and golf club house service was good. I come here pretty frequently with my friends. This weekend the customer service for food/drinks was at an all time low. It took 45 minutes to get our breakfast at signature grill. Then the kicker...was at the Spa pool. So just some background information. You must be  18 to get in the spa ...first time getting carded.  We went in and put belongings away. One of our friends ordered a round of drinks and was carded again. The drinks took an hour to come. That was no big deal.  Waitress finally comes... and wants to card us again. People let's remember I am in the spa!!!!!!!!  The rest of us had locked our purses up. Think relaxing! Who has every gotten carded this many times at a spa in a hotel?? The waitress was rude as hell. And this was the only time that we carded the entire stay. I got so frustrated and cried. We left the spa. We go talk to the manager and he tried to offer us cabana and totally missed that we did not like customer service!! We were not trying to anything free.

Finally one lady said I'll be with you in a minute and continued the what seemed to be the work conversation.... very rude.

Most people are rushing in the mornings and can't wait for someone to do their job who hasn't prepared for it. The guy running the show is very nice but it seems like he needs help.

We called down to the poor man busy as I don't know what (as we had a ticketed event we were going to) and he said when the ""other woman"" arrived he would be up to take care of it. We left everything as it was and put our stuff out of the way in a small pile. We called when we left to verify that it was going to get taken care of and the woman now at the desk was RUDE. They said they don't do house keeping daily during a stay. We explained we just checked in. She asked ""why didn't you say that"", which we were trying to explain to her. She said ""no house keeping will be in until tomorrow"", so still mad, we requested could all the trash be picked up and the dirty sheets taken off and the towels be replaced and just leave us sheets and we will make the bed ourselves. The woman rudely shouted through the phone that they could not do that and they had no other room for us and then HUNG UP ON US!

Later the hotel let us know there was a cancellation so we could move to a different room. But that was a shower and lots of unpacking later...so the boys preferred to stay in the room we were in, instead of moving rooms. So they did their best to correct the issue and overall the stay was good.

In all fairness, the actual room was okay minus the dirty refrigerator and large amount of dust and debris behind the TV.  Usually I don't look behind the TV but because I was trying to plug in cords to a DVD player, it caused me to look there.

Everything was going okay until after I checked out and actually looked at the receipt I was given. My mistake was I didn't look at the receipt until after I left.  The receipt showed misc. charges labeled ""state and local occupancy"" tax.  The odd thing is that I had only used my debit card to rent their refrigerator for the weekend (the hotel doesn't have refrigerators in the rooms).  Those were the only charges I authorized on that card, because I had already provided a credit card for the room stay and incidentals.  When I called the hotel to inquire about the charges, I was transferred to a voicemail for the financial director, Tom.  After Tom didn't call back, I called the hotel again later that day and spoke with a manager.  He explained that the charges were an accident and they would be refunded between 3-5 days.  Day 5 came and still no refund, so I put in a report with the hotel.  As a result, they sent me an email that ""after reviewing your file, the hotel has made contact with you and explained the authorization hold placed on your credit card as well as the timeframe"".  However, this is a lie because the timeframe has come and passed and still no refund.  

I'm now a week and a day since I checked out and still no refund, the financial director hasn't called me back and I have no clue as to when I will see the charges reimbursed to my account.
This is unacceptable and unprofessional!!!!!

I will never again stay at this hotel, because of their poor customer service.  I was given a promise about my money being refunded and that hasn't happened, and I still haven't received a return call from anyone at the hotel itself.

Yes, the furniture is a bit dated.  My Sleep Number bed works just fine.  I have had no issues with cleanliness thus far.  Housekeeping keeps giving me new coffee pouches, which is all I really ask for other than a made bed.  The couch is a little worn, TV in the living room is older but who is watching it there anyways?  The one in the bedroom is just fine.  Seriously, you are paying $70 and get a large bathroom with a tub, two different vanity areas, living room, bathroom, mini fridge, free Wi-Fi, free parking, gorgeous pool area, a very large business center with free printing, etc.  PLUS, they have complimentary breakfast AND in the mornings in the lobby, they not only put out coffee but yummy fruit and granola bars and fiber one bars that you can snag for free!

-a business center with computers that offers a printing service. 

What I was indifferent about this place:
-our window overlooked the busy dekalb pike, but at night you can see the lights of the mall.

What I didn't like about this place:
-small closet with no lights in it.

PROS:
-Front Desk Friendly

-Room was clean

-WIFI

-HUGE outdoor pool 

-Safe box  in the room for valuables

-Free Breakfast for both children & adults

-Inexpensive

-Comfortable beds

-10 minutes from Sesame Place

-Has small kids park / play area in yard

CONS:
-Right dead smack in the middle of construction site ( loud noise & traffic)

-Drains in the bathtub need to be snaked, the pipes are noticeably clogged.

-If you don't get down to the small breakfast buffet right when it opens, your not sitting down to eat.

-The kids entertainment is just free animal balloons and face painting, which is ok, but the lady that does the face painting is rude and actually pushed ( yes pushed) my 6 year old off the line because she was done painting for the morning. My son is small & quiet and didn't understand why she was being so mean. She could have handled that differently. I was infuriated. 

-The cleaning staff speak no English

-Do NOT get a room on the first floor. That is for smokers. that is where the following con comes in to play....

-There are NO elevators !!!!! Have fun lugging up your heavy bags up a flight of stairs.


So honestly, my own personal 2 gripes with this place was the lady that put her hands on my son and pushed him ( not the hotels fault, but they employ her to do children's entertainment and they said nothing when they watched it happen).
Second gripe .... not having elevators. When you have a lot of heavy bags, climbing the stairs with them is no fun.

In most hotels, 3pm is normal check-in time. I let the woman at the desk know that I had reservations (made the reservations two months ago). She advised me that they only had 1 room left and that unfortunately, it was not clean. I asked her what the room number was (since i have other family staying here for my cousins wedding and I wanted to know if I was going to be close to them). She told me she couldn't give me the room number. I asked her why she couldn't give me the room number since it was going to be MY room. She said she was following her policy.

The shower is tiny and you have to place all of your toiletries on the shower floor. There is a seperate bathtub if you are a bath person. The bathroom has 2 sinks in two different areas which is nice since there are 4 of us staying in the room. The water takes A LOOOOONG TIME to warm up. The water pressure is mediocre but I've had worse.

married. 

Someone at the hotel had told my mom and my cousin that the shuttle runs at 11pm and 12am to pick people up from the wedding resort. Someone else found out that the last shuttle runs at 10:30 pm. I'm glad we found this useful information out so that we're not stranded tonight. All of the employees need to be educated on shuttle times so that people aren't stranded in the future. 

My cousin had reserved the honeymoon suite. When she checked in to the hotel, there wasn't one available so she got stuck with a regular room. She was very upset. She ran into a staff member later whom told her that there is absolutely no difference in the honeymoon suite vs. regular rooms other than the fact that it has a jet tub and is a bit bigger (to accommodate the tub). I guess it worked out for her since she didn't get charged for nothing. 

I have one more night in this place, so I'm sure that my review probably isn't over. 

I would definitely stay here again IF they are to remodel the rooms AND get better air conditioning. I can't imagine what the rooms feel like in the summer. Hot hot hot.",2012-03-09 15:04:32

I called the the front desk and I believe his name was Jimmy he assured me would go back and check on my order and got the food finally after 1.5 hrs and took care of the charged.

KMLKQ0WXDIe20I83zjvB5g,BmE_IKPT54fw3qeraYKt5g,kH2bJtlej-8oDv8KjsEzCg,1,0,0,0,"Stayed here last night on a business trip. I was there less than 12 hours total but managed to have a horrible experience.

Check in: The guy at the desk seemed nice, but unfocused (he forgot to give me my credit card back) and a little unprofessional in my opinion - he stated an assumption that the male coworker I was traveling with and I were staying in the same room. OK, not a super crazy assumption to make, especially since I paid for his room, but you really should ask. Also, this was the 5th hotel we checked into on our trip and the first person to say that to us. Usually when you check in they tell you about breakfast, but I had to ask. Then he simply told me they had breakfast in the restaurant, and I had to ask where it was. Any one of these things wasn't a huge deal, but he left a negative impression over all.

Room: The one positive was the room was actually pretty nice. Spacious, clean and super comfortable - just like every other Holiday Inn I've ever visited.

Business center: My coworker tried to print one file but ran into issue after issue with the internet, the printer, drivers etc., which he ended up having to resolve on his own. The internet connection in his room was also super flaky.

Elevators: We had to take the service elevator last night because they told us the regular ones were closed due to renovations, which was fine. Going downstairs this morning I waited for the service elevator for at least 5 minutes. While I was waiting, another guest called the normal elevators, which were right on the other side of the wall, and waited several minutes for one of those. The wait was getting ridiculous so I assumed something was broken and took the stairs - from the 7th floor, with my luggage. I wasn't happy. I later found out that the service elevator was stuck and guests were supposed to go back to using the regular elevators - I have no idea how I should've known this. There was no signage. The normal elevators were apparently just really slow and came eventually.

Breakfast: This morning when I went to the restaurant, I stood in the entrance a minute or 2 before a waiter acknowledged me and the 2 other parties waiting and told us to seat ourselves. There were a lot of unoccupied tables, but most of them weren't bussed yet and had dirty dishes on them. I then had to wait a while to get a menu, and for my order to be taken. There was not a single apology the whole time. The food was fine, but fairly expensive for breakfast.

I left my room at 7:40. It was almost 8:30 when I left the restaurant (and I ate pretty fast). Ridiculous! I was late for my meeting.

Check out: The lady asked if everything was fine with my stay. I said ""sure"" in a tone portrayed how I truly felt. She asked what I meant, but I told her I didn't have time to explain. That was when I decided to Yelp. Thanks for your concern, check-out lady, but you're too late.",2010-12-16 06:37:42

So it is great if you are going to a game and that is your only thing on your agenda. I was sort of irritated that they only have one way airport shuttle service. They will not send the van to pick you up at the airport. But the van will take you to the airport with his attitude and all. Matter of fact just about everyone I spoke with that works at this hotel had a bad attitude, like get out of my face. From the person who checked me in, to the bartender, to the van driver. The restaurant attached to the hotel is way over priced and quite frankly not that great. The only good thing is a comfortable bed but the rooms aren't that nice either.

This particular Fairfield is a prime example of how poor communication and poor management can drive away loyal customers.
Upon checking in I used my personal card to authorize the room staying for a week.  I have a business card which I use to pay the final bill and I will usually switch the card out during my stay only to be charged upon checking out like a normal hotel would.  This is where the runaround starts..
I found out I needed to stay for more work and asked the hotel to extend my stay a week and then again the next week I asked to extend another week, which during that time I changed out the cards like I always do.  When I changed the cards I specifically asked the girl at the desk ""will this card authorize again since I extended?""  Her answer was no it won't be charged until check out so I go about my business.  On the second weekend of my stay the charges start, $850 on Saturday, $870 on Monday, $890 on Monday. So I call and they say the card is trying to authorize, hmm that's weird I was just told it won't and there's not that kind of money kept on the card which I why I specifically asked if it would authorize.  We try and sort it out and I am to come by the desk when I get there that evening no mention at this point that I've been ""removed"" from my room.  Apparently housekeeping told management I don't keep bags in my room so they assumed I checked out.  Before I could even make it back I'm grabbing food after work and I get another charge for $400 and $176!  I then go in to the hotel and talk to the girl at the desk, she was nice but clearly frustrated and couldn't answer my questions, I asked that the manager call me in the morning and asked will my card be charged again before tomorrow which she says no.  I wake up to find more charges, $290!  Which get declined of course.  I went straight to the desk and get greeted by a very angry lady who tells me that they are running a business and they are all competent and was very rude to me and dismissive.  I offer to switch my card to my personal to cover the room she says no and that the manager will call.  At this point I let her know how not once has someone reached out or been able to explain this process to me correctly.  I can say my experience at this Fairfield has been far sub par to say the least, it's clear they don't want to take simple steps to ensure the comfort of their guests and are more concerned about the business and the money.

XvvDzZ4o37bmYyhcCl4-fg,DLS99gknGus5wsXyb4sihA,TTgpKmTSJs1w60DJkWlLWw,2,0,1,0,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights recently to attend our friend's graduation from Widener.  

PROS
We arrived around 1 pm, which is well before the 4 pm check-in time, but our room was ready for us and were able to check in anyway.  The woman who checked us in was nice, patient, and efficient.

The room itself was nice.  The bathroom was clean, well-stocked with towels and travel-size toiletries including individually wrapped makeup remover towelettes, which really made me happy as I had forgotten to pack mine.  We had a room with two queen beds, which were very comfortable and had nice, crisp, white sheets and bedding.  Also, the extra pillows we had requested in our reservation were already on each bed.  

I really liked having a mini-fridge in the room. This allowed us to keep beverages and leftovers from the Ruby Tuesday next door (an easy two-minute walk away) cold.

We were given a $75 credit on our bill for having to put up with multiple spiders in our room (see explanation below in the CONS section).

MINOR ISSUES
The flat screen TV had great picture quality although some channels broadcast considerably louder than others (beware or you may accidentally anger your neighbors).

It would have been nice to have a microwave in the room to heat up leftovers.  As we were staying on the 4th floor, we did not feel like walking all the way down the hall, taking the elevator, using the microwave in the breakfast area, then going all the way back to our room after a long day of sightseeing and visiting with friends.  We were worn out!  

There was apparently a small colony of unknown species of spider taking up residence in room 430.  I woke up both nights to one or two small spiders crawling on my arms.  Also, there were a few spiders spinning webs near the ceiling over the shower.  My husband, however, never noticed them.

CONS
Although the air conditioner was running almost constantly, the humidity in our room never diminished.  It always felt damp and sticky in there.  Each morning, we were eager to shower, dress, and leave the room just to get away from the humidity.  When we did hang out in the room, we turned the air conditioner down to 68 in order to feel comfortable.

We had requested a ground floor room in our reservation but did not receive one at check-in.  Also, the desk attendant did not acknowledge our request, nor did she explain why she was unable to grant it.  

There was a busload of student athletes staying in the hotel at the same time as us and they all but took over the hotel and ran amuck.  The chaperones as well as the students were loud, rude, inconsiderate, and acted as if they ran the place.  At breakfast on Saturday, the kids were taking up 80% of the seats in the breakfast area, talking exceedingly loudly, and the chaperones had taken up an entire long bar-like table with their own coolers of drinks and cardboard boxes full of fruit from Costco.  They were taking up valuable seats and floor space!  When people in that group finished eating, they did not leave.  Rather, they just hung out continuing to be loud and obnoxious.  The hotel staff did nothing to quiet the din, encourage those who were done eating to leave so that other guests could sit down to eat (many were standing or leaning against walls at this point), nor did the staff ask the kids to not break the lines waiting for food to be restocked.  It was a nightmare!

The next day, the pool was overrun with teenagers being loud and crowding the small indoor space.  So, we gave up on ever using our pool passes and my husband promises that we will try to go swimming again on our next trip.  I was very disappointed.

The windows in our room did hardly anything to dampen the sound from the road right outside.  We heard cars with loud mufflers, cars peeling out at the green light, and the trains that went by on the train track adjacent to the road.  We hardly ever heard the airplanes coming in to land at the nearby airport, though, which is weird.  On our last night, a huge helicopter buzzed the hotel right after we had fallen asleep and startled us awake.  Our room was noisy!  Also, anyone talking or walking down the hall can be heard from far away and we heard every door on our floor open and close.  It was very hard to sleep except between 11 pm and 6 am.

I didn't believe for one second that this hotel is worth the price we paid.  For $169 a night, I expect low humidity, a nice peaceful breakfast with adequately stocked food containers at all times, staff to ensure that guests are courteous to one another, and that younger guests are asked to behave accordingly when they get out of hand.

We were charged $26.20 per day in occupancy and city taxes, which amounted to nearly $75 in unexpected charges.  So, after our room rebate is considered, we were only refunded the tax money we paid and did not actually receive a discount for the lower than expected quality of our room.",2015-05-21 15:24:22

Pros
The free breakfast was pretty good. They served waffles, sausages, and eggs in addition to the regular continental breakfast of bagels, oatmeal, and cereal.  The hotel was packed but quite, which was nice.  Lastly, each maid was very nice, so we made sure to leave a tip in the room when we checked out.

Cons
The hotel staff were extremely unprofessional! The night shift clerk was playing video games on the TV in the lobby, paying no attention to guest.  Due to her inability to focus on anything besides her video game, she gave us a new room because our key to room 111 did not work and never switched our room in their computer system.  The next morning the hotel clerk called and asked us why we hadn't checked out.  Mind you, we were not scheduled to check out for 2 more days.  After trying to explain this to her for almost 10 min. she figured out the issue.  In addition, the hotel carpet was gross, the bathroom in the room was horrible, and there was hardly any parking.

I booked the hotel a couple days in advance through Expedia. I booked for a 2 queen beds including the pet fee because we were traveling with my dog. The woman at the check in desk was quite rude. She originally assigned us a regular room but sighed and looked annoyed when we mentioned we had a pet. Nonetheless, after waiting half an hour for things to be sorted out, we were all pretty tired from a 6+ hour drive to get there. I was already bothered about the bad service, but it gets worse. When we went in, the room smelled like smoke even though it was a non-smoking room. On top of that, when we walked in, there was a fly buzzing around the room. Pretty gross. Not sure if it was the room we were assigned, but our room was seriously outdated. Carpets produced a nauseating smell because it was so old.  At least the sheets were clean... I think. I question everything now. 

Some yelper mentioned that she paid for a pet room, and received some special amenities for their pet such as a bed, blanket, and some treats for dogs. I received none of those in my room. It was 12am already and I was exhausted. They didn't have my room ready and I paid an extra $50 for a pet even though my pet received no special treatment.

We are from Noblesville, IN which is just north of Indianapolis. The hotel was easy to find; however, parking was a little confusing at first. There is a public parking garage right next to the hotel, but we of course parked on the wrong side of it and had to walk thru an alley that was pretty gross. Make sure you park by the 12th street elevator! Fortunately, when we walked up to the hotel there was a bell hop (is that what they are still called?) named ""T"" who was SUPER nice and took a cart and my dad back to the garage and moved our car and unloaded everything for us. He made an annoying mistake not a big deal.  

Check in was fine, the room was nice. Kind of long and skinny, the kitchen was great to have (I specifically only searched for hotels with kitchens), but the bathroom was the worst part. I didn't like the walk in shower and pocket door. Would have been fine if just adults, but with a 1,3,8, and 10 year old allllll they wanted to do was play with the door. The bowls provided were small. If you are bringing kids, pack paper plates and bowls!

We booked our room in March, I honestly would have thought we would have gotten a nicer location. Our room was 333, which overlooked air conditioning units. This didn't bother me too much because we weren't in our room except in the evening and to sleep. I was too busy with 4 kids to really sit by a window and enjoy a view of anything anyway. 

The TV is placed in a weird location, so everyone can (sorta) see it. The room was long enough, there really should be 2 TVs. We had a 2 queen suite with a pullout couch. Plenty of space for our stuff, the room was clean and lots of towels in the bathroom. 

The staff was awesome getting us a pack and play and setting it up.  It was a really nice one and was super clean.  

Didn't care for the continental breakfast. Again, might be ok if just adults...it was super crowded every morning we went and they were out of 2% milk 2 mornings we were there. I don't drink milk so I don't care, but my kids were pretty grossed out by skim milk!

Pool was decent and I loved using the laundry facilities (only .50 per wash and .50 per dry). I felt very safe in this hotel, as you can't get off the elevator unless you have your room key. 

Staff was excellent. One star was taken for parking and room size. I paid 174 bucks for 4 nights of parking - yikes! Despite some of the flaws, I would definitely stay again if ever in Philly. I am not a big Airbnb fan, as I like the security and room service hotels provide. This hotel definitely has wonderful and helpful staff!!!!!",2017-08-04 12:17:23

Anywhoo
I finally got around to calling Quality Inn and talked with Lupe who was just a gem! She was lovely, polite, and helpful on the phone. The room rates were the best price I received in the area. Plus they have a complimentary breakfest.

Well while getting dressed my cousin noticed small bug on the bed so we ended up snapping a picture that we enlarged and Googled ""bed bugs"". It was  pretty solid match. Disgusting- we evacuated immediately and informed the front desk. The check-in customer service was mediocre and border line rude and the check-out person was about the same and he seemed not concerned or surprised at all about the bed bugs. I was able to get a refund via Orbitz (we were only there an hour)- but when I last checked Orbitz had not uploaded my review. I kept the review just like this one- just the facts that I experienced- no foul language, no names, no personal attacks etc., which now leaves me to believe that Orbitz is more concerned with the fees or kick backs they receive than from posting honest reviews.

I'm packing my bag and I'm preparing to check out, but this review is immediately important.

I selected this place on the recommendation of someone who unfortunately has never spent a moment on premises.
All the negative reviews are 100% accurate.

This is allegedly a no smoking facility, but it is wholly infused with the raw, dense, offensive, stale reek of cigarettes. 
Everything is dirty, dim and dingy from floor to ceiling.
No toilet paper, no tissues, sandpaper towels, sticky dried liquids on the end tables, sinks dusted with old makeup, etc.
My personal fave is the dense cluster of aging cobwebs where wall meets ceiling.
Cleaning crew must have been on vacation since Reagan was president.
Bath/shower caulking is a myriad of ragged colors from moldy black to yellow to a not-bright, white.
This is among the dirtiest facilities I have ever encountered. 
Filth is the inexcusable norm at this disgusting excuse for a hotel/motel.
And, noisy, not relaxing - I heard the obnoxious teens/twenty-somethings next door all night, slamming doors and shouting.

This place doesn't need renovation, it needs an air strike. 
It's revoltingly dirty.

They always go out of their way to give you directions, explain the hotel, etc.  The Residence Inn at Speedway has the old-fashioned townhouse-like rooms.  I never bother getting a suite there so this was a real treat at the Residence Inn at the airport.    This is where the comparison starts to get a little strange.  At the Residence Inn at Speedway the woman that does the breakfast is SO NICE.  She's always running back and forth, making sure that the eggs are fresh, if anyone needs help, etc.  The woman at the Residence Inn at the airport could not care less.  I stopped eating breakfast there rather than dealing with her and her over-peppered eggs.  On Monday, we were out of eggs at 7:00 AM (breakfast was supposed to start at 6:30) and I had to get to work.  She just looked at me and said, ""What do you want me to do?""  ....uhhhh make some eggs?  Maybe?  Then they ran out of coffee.

They said we are busy and we can provide you in next hour. I thought that is okay, but nobody came. I went down and gave iron to the staff and they said they will replace the iron soon. Another 15 mins wait, and nobody came. To my frustration, I decided to just leave the hotel and get done with it.

They have a nice hotel setup, but the problems we faced were very basic - coffee/creamer/iron. These are just so trivial things and if a hotel is upsetting its customers with these basic things - then I must say that hotel should not continue operation. If they do not have staff, then better to shut down the hotel rather than upsetting customers. The quality of service was very poor! Staff and the service was rude!!!",2015-08-17 17:37:58

1. Unacceptably understaffed. One lady mans the front desk, and shares her one nighttime staff member or handyman with the neighboring hotel during frequent emergencies.
2. Facilities in massive disrepair. They will tell you it is currently being renovated, so listen to them and stay away until they are *absolutely finished* with renovations, whenever that is. Heaters rattle loudly or are broken in some rooms. If something is broken, and a maintenance guy comes, he may leave without cleaning up the mess behind him. Doors will not close/lock easily or automatically in many rooms due to unprofessionally reapplied door paint. Curtains are worn down with unexplained holes. Leaking hallway ceiling. Some faucets jut out from the wall.

The ice bucket is dirty. the towels are used. and the sheets, while moderately clean. are severely stained. the floor looks like that of a public school. the ample flatscreen TV is the highest quality knock off China can offer, so it's got that going for it.

We didn't use the shower as we had showered at home before we left for the hotel. The bed wasn't too firm, but it was a bit firmer than I prefer. Overall, not a dealbreaker. The hotel is easy to find and it's very close to the airport which are the two pros it has going for it. They allow you to park your car for the duration of your trip and advertise that it is ""secure"" yet both entering and leaving the property the security booth was unmanned. So how secure could it be?? The cons? Well, the drivers of the shuttles we had were extremely rude and didn't seem to care about the passengers utilizing this service. The front desk staff varied. When we checked in, the young man at the desk wasn't very personable and basically just told us our room number. The woman we had in the morning for our check was extremely pleasant and helpful with shuttle times and how that process worked.

He was outside smoking his vape while we were trying to find a parking spot as an Rv Trailer and a truck were blocking the exit to the back lot. He told us to park in the back and we will fit by. Well my friends card was declined because he had froze his credit account and forgot to unfreeze it before using it to pay for the room. When we got there we fixed it and then we went upstairs where we realized when we got to the fourth floor that our keys were deactivated. So we went outside to go seat h for the employee.

I was very upset the employee was kind enough to move her can over so I can park in a white lined parking spot. There needs to be more observation on this because it's ridiculous.
Other notes. The breakfast was decent for the free breakfast. Cereal, waffles, bread and bagels, and biscuits and gravy and one day was bacon and the other was sausage.

We were going to come back here again next month but we cancelled the reservation after todays stay.

omGRHMOIqkQt_27HbZxmwg,0A8UK0YvzymT6RcGmbd8NQ,q5GJL9IhdfAy5hL0-1-wzA,2,2,0,0,"Pros: This hotel is close to Doylestown and that's what we needed. The bed was extremely comfortable and we could set the thermostat to a very cold temperature, which I appreciated.

Cons: The rooms look brand new but there is not much storage for clothes. In a room with a king bed you'd expect it's 2 people but I had to live out of my suitcase as the one 'dresser' had room for just my husband's clothes.

There is *zero* customer service. Cleary, the folks working the front desk hate their job. 

In the morning, we had to ask the front desk for the microwavable egg sandwich (which is silly), so we apologetically went to the front desk to ask for one. The male manager said NOTHING in response to our request, walked next to us while ignoring out attempts at jokes and handed us the item without saying ONE WORD. Weird and very unprofessional.

More than once, in the evening, we asked the female manager if the fire pit was on. We were told ""Not yet, it needs to be darker out *and* then someone has to ask"". Ummm, we're asking *now*. She acted like the cost of the propane came out of her check. Totally ridiculous. Once it was finally turned on, we found out 2 other guests went as far as offering her money to turn it on because she fought them on it too. She REALLY didn't want to turn that fire pit on. 
I've stayed at hotels with fire pits and they are *always* on - you aren't expected to BEG for it. 
Pro tip: If you're going to use the fire pit as a selling point on your website (and it's a pandemic where folks can't sit inside together)........TURN IT ON without expecting your paying guests to beg you to do so.

The breakfast was crappy, not the usual decent Hampton Inn breakfast but that's not their fault, it's due to Covid protocols and we expected it, so that wasn't a big deal.",2021-04-25 22:15:28

1. I called and requested an early check in and was assured there would be no problem. I arrived  at 9AM with my toddler and was told I couldn't check in until 4. Seeing that I knew no one in the city, my child and I wondered around for hours (with our luggage) we had no place to go.

2. When I finally arrived to the hotel after being in the heat all day I was greeted by a ""queen"" at the front desk who was very rude. I mean lip smacking, finger-waving....this guy was rude. He completely lacked empathy. 

3. I finally check into this hotel and nearly all of the amenities listed on their site were not working. The fridge was out. The laundry machines were broken. 

4. I went to the front desk to ask for ice as my kid and I had been outside in the sun most of the day. The clerk (Tatiyana) sat in her chair eating instead of coming to the window to address my concern. I asked her about ice and she shouted from across the room ""WE DONT GIVE OUT NO CUPS FOR ICE"". I was like...do you have an ice bucket? There are usually ice buckets and cups in hotel rooms. She shouted back ""I SAID NO CUPS AND BUCKETS EITHER"". By this time I am really starting to hate the staff and the hotel. 

5. Would you believe that during our ENTIRE stay housekeeping never visited. We had to use the same towels for days. I was too intimidated to go to the front desk to ask for anything because the staff is so aggressive and ghetto. 

6. I am not from Philly so I was not aware of the area. Be warned. This hotel, the staff, and the guests are very ghetto. This is a seedy area. Prostitutes, drug addicts, drug dealers. DO NOT STAY HERE. To top it off the staff could give less than a damn about you.",2021-09-21 19:44:56

1.  They don't have bus service from the airport to the hotel, and they call this an airport hotel?

2.  Their toilet was making sounds the whole night and I called to have them come and fix it and they never did

3.  The hair dryer wasn't working

4.  I had a wakeup call at 6am, and never got it and the operator had the nerve to tell me it was setup in the system and it was my fault I never got it.  She calls back and has the nerve to tell me that I was rude to hang up on her because I was in a rush now.

5.  I go downstairs to check out and I ask for the airport shuttle and tell them my story, and I accidentally was talking to the driver of the shuttle and not the hotel staff.  The hotel staff decided to help the person that came AFTER me because I was talking to the driver.  When the hotel staff finally talked to me, the phone operator happened to be down there and started yelling back at me that it was my fault because my wakeup call was in the system.  I later found out, THEIR system was down.

We get into the room and it's the most disgusting room I have ever been in.  It's smelled like a men's bathroom at a gas station.  Very strong smell of urine and smoke.  Trues to call the front desk from the room phone, however that phone didn't work
I then called on my cell phone to try to cancel the room and get a refund, she replied that she can't because there is no manager there and that she can't cancel it because we booked the room not her.  We then asked if some one could clean the room.  She said that she's the only one there and that we have to deal with it.  There was a big bag of trash outside our door upon entry, and the floor was all cracked and the table was dirty and slimy.
Never stay at this place ever, worst experience with a motel ever.  And even worse was the lady at the front desk.  It's obvious she hates her job and hates interacting with people.",2022-01-02 03:48:22

I thought this would be a good place to stay, it's near a hospital that I'm working at on a contract. There is a lot of restaurants, grocery stores, a Costco... I clearly did not do my research on this hotel. Room look clean when I got into it, room smelled like old cigarettes even though it was a non-smoking room. Tip of the day; go by yourself some dryer sheets and put them in front of the air conditioner and it helps a little bit with the smell. 

I literally slept with the lights on because as soon as you turn the lights off, cockroaches come out of the bathroom. Do to my schedule at the hospital I really didn't have anywhere else to go last minute. you get what you pay for that's for sure, I am willing to pay $100+ a night to stay at a hotel that I know that does not have bugs. This morning I woke up and was bit by something on my stomach and it's still inflamed and red. 

I went to check out today I DIDN'T even ask for my money back for the next 2 days. It was stated that I wouldn't get my money back because I'm canceling ahead of time, and  because of my corporate discount...cool. All I said was I'm leaving because there's bugs in my room and proceeded to explain. Still didn't ask for my money back. The Hispanic girl was really nice, the lady with the short hair not sure if she was some sort of Manager was nothing but rude. She proceeded to go to the room and go look for bugs I'm assuming. I was asked just to wait in the office so I did. she comes back to the office ignores me and ask some maintenance man if they do exterminations for cockroaches. He explained to her they don't do roaches...  she's speaking loud enough to where I can hear her. she explains to his maintenance person that the ""lady out in the office is claiming that there were cockroaches and I don't see any signs of cockroaches"". Here in Tucson we have different bugs here you know living in Tucson. Being totally condescending. No one came back to even tell me to go away, sorry we don't see there's a problem, not a f You, nothing. Literally left me standing there, so I left. One of the rudest Manager or whatever she was I've ever dealt with. 

So I'm keeping it a  real I'm going to put it on social media so NONE of my Traveling Nurses/Scrub Techs go to this hotel. Going to let my Corporate office too.

 When I checked in on Sunday afternoon the staff was so nice and so helpful. This lady today with the short hair, does not need to be in customer service she totally sucks. she can go turn the lights off and see all the little friends with all the legs that come out and then give me attitude. 


I am a traveler, I have been all over the place for work and vacations. I've stayed in third world countries that were cleaner and had more respect than this hotel.

I POSTED PICTURES OF THE ROOM and I demand a full refund.

Don't be misled Marriott frequenters. This place is beyond run down and very little care has been invested into this property. 

Checking in, we had to wait for the front desk associate to finish up his call, while leaning up against his car that he parks under the front overhang (nice valet touch for him). Once we checked in, I provided him my ID and credit card... he ignored it and said it's not needed. Nice enough guy, but it's apparent he doesn't enjoy his job. 

The hallways have a horrible musty smell and are dirty and dated. However, a step up from my room. (Be sure to check out my pictures)

The room was absolutely disgusting. 
Carpet - stained/worn to the wood
Curtain - mold and nasty finger prints
Walls - dirty/ finger prints/smears every where. 
Bed Skirt -stained (don't want to know)
Bathroom -Sink Cracked, Tiles Cracked
Shower - Mold/ empty soap dispenser
Bed comforter- stained 
Smell - mildew and smoke

This is an absolute joke. All night long, doors slamming, people yelling in the hallways, people hanging out in the parking lot all night. BTW, parking lot had trash everywhere. The highlight of this stay was leaving at 6am. 

I was traveling with three other work associates and all three said their rooms were equally gross and in a similar state. 

There are other hotels within a block. Do yourself a favor and pick one of those. I am definitely not one to complain about hotels in the business categories, but this hotel needs to be immediately addressed by Marriott and the franchise rights should be pulled.

We stayed at this hotel many times and have recommended this establishment even this last weekend two of their rooms were booked based on our recommendations. We booked a jacuzzi suite for our 27th aniversery because the night we married we stayed with this hotel. Mind you a month early and a smoking room like we had in February when we stayed for Valentine's day. 

 When we arrived I explained this to the front office. We went to our room to find another person's clothing in our room, we called the front desk,two hours later and after another call to the front desk someone came and got the clothing. The jacuzzi was very low on water and construction was going on all around us  very loud construction. We went to the front desk to ask when the smoking policy changed and to ask why we had to call for the email confirmation that changed our room type on October 1 when we booked September 1? The front end person turned us over to a very rude and loud manager who told us we could leave.i was upset that they would treat return guests so badly. I guess the new general manager just doesn't care for his guests if he will allow managers to treat guests like they should just put up with bad service, dirty rooms and a jacuzzi that is broken? We left and went back to our room as this was our aniversery and we planned to have family from out of town meet us late on Friday so leaving was not a viable option.  The construction went on over our head and up and down the whole aisle we were surrounded by banging sawing cutting drilling the whole time early morning to late in the evening. Listening to bad language from the workers and smelling strong odors of pot almost like clockwork at 7:30 pm. I guess that type of smoking is allowed.

The housekeeper  never had towels or toilet paper on her cart, and I had to call many times but it did eventually come about two hours later, each time. The last day we had to use tissues because no toilet paper would come. The jucuzzie was so low on water maintenance would come add water and chemicals to the spa,30 minutes later the spa was so cold we could not use it called again they retuned to tell us the accidentally turned the pump off and they wanted it to be perfect but it was NOT  perfect it was unusable.  The manager of maintenance said we would get 2000 bonus points  but have not gotten them. We used the spa on our aniversery  the 6th only to be chemically burned both us to the point we needed medication and we are still trying to heal. We left Sunday to receive a call from someone at the hotel stating she was sorry and she would call me back but now it is Tuesday and still no customer service here? 

I was told more than once they would make some forms of adjustment for this horrible experience but guess what nothing was done, no one called and everytime I was told it was up to the general manager  not a word, but charged our credit card full price for a room we could not use without injury. Like I said this used to be my favorite place to spend with my spouse,  but after this anniversary I am looking for a place where we are welcome and can use toilet paper.",2017-10-11 01:22:33

The toilet makes a high pitches whistling noise when you flush it that wakes everyone up and the hot and cold handle on the sink are hard to turn on and off.

First - checked in and got a room# and was told that it's in the west wing, without map it's a scavenger hunt to find Room 117.  Also, at night there are no lights on the grounds near the pool so better bring a flashlight.
Second - didn't rent a car but wanted to go to Tucson Spectrum to catch a movie, but front desk says the hotel shuttle van can only take guest to locations up to 3 miles away...I guess Sheraton don't believe in ""going the extra mile"" to satisfy customer needs.  Well, in this case, it's 2 extra miles, since the Spectrum is 5 miles from the hotel.
Third - walked by a group of hotel staff smoking next the pool, which is adjacent to the restaurant.  What a disgrace to have guests in this high traffic area smell your cigarette puffs.

I was first assigned a regular, clean room (southwest comp) that smelled of nicotine covered by a blend of old lady perfume and Jersey Shore cologne. I understand that it's not their fault if someone breaks the no smoking room; however, I am surprised that nothing was done to clear it out (although the windows do not open). The room's paint color made it seem a bit institutional, as it had that basic industrial bulk bought tan color. Part of me wondered if this was nicotine stained walls. 

I went to the concierge, and John at the front desk was so gracious. I asked for two beds instead of one, since a friend decided to come slumber party it with me. He upgraded me for free to a room with a balcony. Score! 

In my new room, there weren't any olfactory  offensives. I could open the screen door to the balcony and experience a rare Arizona breeze. The courtyard area is charming, providing a nice view. 

The bed and pillows were significantly better quality, plush yet firm. The beds in the substandard room were squishy, covered with a loud featherbed. But once I settled into my comfy bed, I perused the cable (Showtime!), whilst reading magazines on my iPad, using their complimentary wifi. What a way to relax after anxiously awaiting a plane departure. 

The shower/bathtub was spacious. But more important, it had excellent water pressure and there were plenty of towels provided. 

The complimentary Dasani waters are a nice touch, as is the fruit infused water in the lobby.

I am not one for conflict so I told him I will take the room. Of course the room was the SAME location again just a different floor near the ice maker, high traffic and the elevator. In requesting a different room I was told there weren't any more of my type of room available and I agreed to take a downgraded room and that I just wanted to be away from the noise of the kids. I never in my LIFE felt so disrespected, bullied, and humiliated while in a vulnerable position because I needed to stay in this hotel. It was obvious he only agreed to bring my key to me to avoid being on the cameras that were at the front desk. I gave this hotel 2 stars because the rooms are actually decent, and when I escalated the situation in the morning the director of sales and the on duty manager Kelly were very accommodating and took the time to listen to me and apologized on Nick's behalf and that made up for how I was backed into a corner by Nick. If a friendly staff is what is important to you in a hotel, I would HIGHLY suggest you not stay here while NICK WILLIAMSOM is still employed here. If he is, If you are not satisfied with your room, you will be made to feel like a burden and an inconvenience by him if you request to change it. And if you request to change it again due to loud noise of other guests (in which him as a manager should have controlled), you will be bullied and humiliated. This guy has no business working in a leadership role in the hospitality industry. 3 times I requested a room away from the elevator and ice maker and EACH time I was moved to a the same rooms ending in ""08"" next to the elevator and ice maker and told there were no other rooms available in which after my due diligence I found out was a lie. SMH.. The GM and Director of Sales did make efforts to accommodate me by giving me 2 nights stay via my reward points but I would never use them here.",2014-11-15 00:14:53

We were driving in and arriving late and the woman who checked us in kept talking about 3pm checkin when our reservation indicated we would be arriving very late night/wee hours of the morning. My husband selected this motel b/c they claim to be dog friendly. They do not however, feel the need to inform guests of policies regarding dogs. They certainly remembered to add the $20 pet deposit to the bill though.

We have a yorkie that we kenneled when we left to the airport to welcome my stepdaughter home from deployment. The room wasn't attended as a result. My husband mentioned that while we were out our room had not been attended. They sent towels up and promised that the room would be cleaned in the a.m. As we left yesterday morning my husband saw the room attendants in the hall and asked them to clean our room. As we were leaving, my husband took the attritional step of mentioning it (room cleaning) at the front desk. The front desk person then rudely tells us that our dog could not be left 'unattended' in the room. Thanks for the late informations! We then still had to step out to the mall to pick up some things for my stepdaughter's house. We later noticed missed called from Ms. Notsofriendly telling us our dog was barking and that she had 'concerns'. Ummmm....DOGS BARK.

When we returned to the hotel, they had locked us out of our room. We returned to the front desk and asked why. The lady (person who checked us in & never informed us of motel dog policy) said that our dog was a problem b/c she was barking. Sooooooo the solution is to lock people out of rooms as 'punishment'?! I'm looking forward to checkout & to never check into this hell hole ever again.

About the room: It smells stale. Thank God the window opened so we could actually get some fresh air. The room attendants do precious little when 'cleaning'. I suppose they need to conserve their energy for standing in the halls talking. They don't wipe down surfaces and they basically change the towels, 'make up' the bed and roll out. After they 'clean' it certainly doesn't look or smell clean.

I didn't rent a car so I dealt with taking the train to the airport and then their airport shuttle to get here the evening before. It all worked out great. Tried out their restaurant and had a Philly Cheese steak and also a side of  asparagus (which I loved!). Weird situation occurred when I had to pay. He asked for cash or otherwise he'd have to take my credit card to the main lobby area for me to pay. I opted for the latter, but really? Apparently he said they got hacked recently, but still, sounds a bit odd. There was only one other person there in the restaurant when I was there, and she came in after I did. Guess I should have figured out with no one in there, before I sat down, that perhaps I should have gone somewhere else to eat.

I was hoping to take a quick swim in the pool but it was full of families and other folks so I ended up passing this time around.

Early morning breakfast was not very accommodating regarding my early flight like other Hilton owned hotels. I found the staff pretty rude and stiff and due to how they acted, likely will chose another hotel to stay in instead the next time i am in the area.",2016-11-13 19:35:25
N7SXstbHu-nM8UtdiH_Eug,fN555Lvrh93wplzUtYCs3A,EMviUh7Lud2nqnarrqi_tQ,1,0,0,0,"I was driving from Florida to PA with my 3 year old son to get to my infant child who has been hospitalized since birth. 
He had a heart transplant in Florida and only CHOP is able to help my son. He's immunio suppressed. 
I called the hotel to make reservations, a man with a heavy Indian accent (not racist towards any ethnicity) I could BARELY understand him. I did ask him specifically if there were cockroaches in the hotel, he said no. He advised me to go book with hotels.com
I was transferred over to Wyndham garden in reservations DEPT and spoke with a 'Michael'. Another man with a heavy Indian accent who spelled my name wrong, got my email address wrong Never sent me a confirmation number. 
Tired and over whelmed as my child is extremely sick, we pull into the property. I see cockroaches around the doors. I did NOT bother to go to the lobby. 
*Note, I stayed in the Wyndham Garden hotel in Gainseville Florida, excellent people there. 

When I called him to tell him I would NOT be coming since I made my reservation on the contingency there were no cockroaches, his English magically became understandable. He told me I had made a 5 night reservation and since I didn't cancel within 24 hours he's keeping my $82 plus taxes. 
That's extremely insulting when I had made the reservation maybe 4 hours prior to check in. I was lied to about cockroaches. The place even smells disgusting when you walk by the doors. 
If you are a CHOP parent, it's better to sleep in the car than this place. Cockroaches have salmonella. The last thing you want to bring into your child's ICU room is germs and or bed bugs. 
*Note, I cannot say this place has bed bugs as once I saw the roaches outside, no way was I going to enter the lobby or check in to see if there were any bed bugs. 
I tried to reason with him and was met with yelling, multiple transfers to a call center. 

They never did send me an email for a confirmation because of course, 'Michael' from the main reservations line for Wyndham properties was more interested in selling me the third party services VS making the reservation. Upon calling back due to not having a reservation email, another woman from an Indian call center said my name was spelled wrong and they took the wrong email. The only thing the Wyndam reservation's line knows to do is take credit card numbers. 

I was then told to call another number in the morning, transferred yet again multiple times and originally told to 'wait for a specialist to 'find out what happened'. Reference # 4097267

Any parent with an extremely ill child should not have to wait a week for someone to contact you back especially when you're in an ICU with a complex sick child. This is a mountain of headache and siphons time from taking care of your child in an ICU. 
If they tell you they're going to investigate - it's stalling time so you do not have time to refute with your bank. 
It's simple, the hotel is not Wynham's standards. There is nothing to investigate. 

The hotel is littered with cockroaches, email a confirmation number of a refund. At least have integrity of embarrassment when someone doesn't show up to your lobby due to your filthy premises to issue a refund for a botched reservation made no less than 4 hours prior. 

In addition to that, I found myself having to search for yet another hotel in the middle of the night from a gas station parking lot which was another 40 minutes. Time which could had been spent sleeping to get to my sick child sooner in the morning.

I believe the front desk clerk should be fired but this is clearly how the manager permits this PARTICULAR Wyndham property to operate.",2018-09-06 16:13:53

This Holiday Inn Express, which is right near the airport, is the worst we have ever experienced. 

The good:
Plenty of parking, a ceiling fan in the room (big plus, air circulation was great), first floor for easy access, HBO in the room, a very nice TV, refrigerator and microwave were very clean, and the temperature could be controlled by a wall thermostat instead of the usual wall unit under the window. 

The not so good:

Service was good but the hostess was grouchy when we first arrived. She wasn't rude, but maybe had just had a rough day. Not a big deal, would have never thought twice about it.

Unfortunately, it only got worse from there. Something (I'm assuming an air conditioning vent that I observed from the wall in the hall) was taped just inside the door above the sink vanity with hot pink duct tape. 

The walls next to the first bed looked like someone had rubbed dirt all over the lower section of the wall. There were brown and black marks everywhere. 

The bed sheets were not only made poorly, but were also stained. Both the fitted sheet and the comforter had brown spots and smears on them. We had to go to the front desk and get another sheet to replace the original before we could go to sleep. The bed skirts were also stained.

The wall underneath the shower head was covered in soap scum. Had this been a permanent stain from the water, I would have understood. However, after a quick wipe with a wet napkin, it came right off. Clearly it just hadn't been cleaned. 

Also, during a movie we were watching on the tv right before sleeping, (not PPV, just on cable) the service cut out. While they surely cannot be blamed for this, it definitely did not help the experience.

Choose wisely. We will most likely not stay at this location again.",2017-06-09 04:00:50

So this was unfortunately my 2nd stay here. We had a minor complaint about the general cleanliness and rude treatment by the staff the last time (2008-ish), which Corporate promised to address. Fast forward to this weekend (I was tricked into coming here by my family after several blissful days in a 5-star hotel in center city). Now, the exterior is deceptive, b/c you think you are getting a standard 3-star hotel. Until you enter and smell the place. It is rank! It absolutely smells moldy, and like they do not clean (they don't! see below) 

During our last stay, the  rooms weren't pristine, but it actually was not too bad, for the price. This past weekend, we were assigned a room that smelled like a combination of human waste and decomposition. The carpet was stained with something with a foul odor, and the linen didn't appear to be clean.

The best part was that when we informed the night manager, he responded that there was nothing he could do as they did not have ""a night maid on site"". And then he handed us some air freshener. Added bonus - the next morning, as we were attempting to check out (skipped the yucky-looking breakfast!) I noticed that the mess that some kids had made on the tables the night before had not been cleaned up. 

This entire stay was a nightmare.

The person who checked me in last night was visibly annoyed that I arrived and that he needed to leave the apparent PARTY going on in the back office.

I started to ask where to park and was immediately cut off and told ""I'll get to that after I finish checking you in!"" All of this and still not so much as a fleeting moment of eye contact or a smile.  What else did I NOT receive? Glad you asked! I booked and received confirmation for a QUEEN bed.  Evidently, that means nothing...or so I learned when I got to the room. I called to ask if I could move and was told they were sold out of Queen Rooms.  Hmmmmm....it would have been nice to have been told that when I checked in.

I WAS given my complimentary cookie (again with much attitude) and then heard ""oh, sorry...it is not hot!""  Clearly...the guy may have been a lot of things but sorry? I so doubt it!

Then...the television didn't work.  Called the Front Desk (assuming the party was still in full effect) but got no answer.  So...took the miniature elevator back down.  Found a young woman this time.  Equally as disinterested in assisting me.  She actually walked away while I was talking.  I guess I have to give her points as some guy did show up.

I wouldn't suggest this hotel for anything longer than a night (or two, max). It's a small room but if you need a place to crash for the night, it serves it's purpose. My girlfriend and I were recently there and it was a very stressful situation. 

After speaking to a nice woman named Danielle, I made our reservation over the phone. I happened to call back the following day with a quick question. The man with a very strong Indian accent (I can't use the word ""gentleman"" because he was one of the MOST rude, ignorant individuals I have ever come across) I spoke to on the phone, (his name was Paul) could not find our reservation even after supplying him with the confirmation number 3 times and spelling out my last name several times as well. Paul did not seem to care if he found our reservation in the system or not. Finally after going back and forth with someone who clearly did not want to offer any type of assistance, I asked to speak to someone else (preferably someone I could understand clearly). 

The next person that I reached was yet another man with a very strong Indian accent. His name was Harry and he identified himself as the manager. Finally, he found my reservation in their system but told me that I made the reservation two weeks past the date in which I had reserved the room. I clearly know when I made the reservation for yet this man insisted that I was wrong. Come to find out, Danielle must have incorrectly marked us down in the incorrect date/slot which was a honest mistake. After another 15-20 minutes of being on the phone, Harry squeezed me into another slot on the day in which I had originally  booked the room for. Ahhh finally, it's all taken care of. NOPE! 

Upon opening the email confirmation within minutes of getting off the phone, I find out that the cost of the room which I had booked was now almost DOUBLE the price! I immediately called back and Paul told me that Harry was not available as he was in a meeting. After explaining the situation to Paul (who still did not seem to care to help me whatsoever), I became increasingly frustrated. Paul told me that no one except Harry can change the price back to what I was originally quoted and now instead of being in a meeting, I was told that Harry was gone for the weekend and would not return until after our visit. Clearly, he had lied to me and for some reason; did not want me to speak to Harry. Paul continued to yell at me, speak to me like a piece of trash and told me that he will not do anything to help me resolve this situation. I explained to him that TWO people there at the hotel quoted me a specific price, yet the confirmation I was sent showed a price nearly double. 

Being that this hotel is a subsidiary of a large corporation such as Wyndham, I explained to Paul that I will then call the corporate phone number and explain this situation to them and inform them how unprofessional he has been. His response was ""go ahead and call, I don't care what you do"". Way to keep it classy Microtel front desk guy! 

Now, after another 45 minutes of being on the phone with the customer care representative and explaining the situation once again; I was told that there was nothing they could do to resolve the situation until they investigate it further and get back to me within 4-5 days. Lovely! After being defeated and clearly frustrated, I hung up.

We arrived at the Microtel around 3:00pm the following day and who do I find at the front desk? Yep, Paul. Employee of the Year looking miserable and speaking extremely rude to us and other customers. His face clearly matched the rude voice on the phone. As he proceeded to check us in, I explained who I was and he said ""yeah I remember you and there is nothing I can do"". I noticed another female employee there and upon reading her name tag, I noticed that it was Danielle who I originally spoke to. 

When I asked to speak to her, Paul said ""yeah go over and talk to her"" instead of offering to get Danielle's attention for a customer seeking assistance. So by now, I had to walk outside to track down Danielle who I have never met before. Little did I know, her work shift was over and she was getting ready to leave. I apologized for bothering her and explained who I was and the horrible situation that I have been through. Thankfully she recognized who I was and remembered speaking to me. 

She came back inside the hotel and informed Paul the correct price amount which I was quoted by herself and the manager. She must have needed proper authorization to manually change a price in their computer and made the necessary calls. The whole time, Paul stood there and did not offer to help at all. While Danielle finished checking us in, she apologized for the hassle. 

Had it not been for her, we would have spent nearly twice as much to stay there. Big thanks for her for taking the time to help us when Paul treated us like trash!",2013-06-10 18:29:58

Firstly, we made our reservation for the room 2 weeks in advance and they rudely called December 30th to confirm we were coming in on December 31st. Key word there was ""rudely,"" that was the first red flag. Then we arrive on December 31st to our (first) room and were horrified. The side of the building we were put was A. under construction and B. extremely unsafe with the corroding floors and scary elevator ride. Once we got into the (first) room, we noticed the floors had dirt all over then so we decided to look at the beds and check it out to see how the rest of it was. The sheets were dirty with stains, possibly someone else makeup (meaning the sheets were NOT washed), along with hairs all over the pillows and a half a roll of toilet paper..We had no other choice but to stay at this hotel because it was NYE and nowhere else had availability, which is why we made the reservations 2 weeks ahead of time. We then went to the front desk and they provided us a new room....but told us the wrong room. The most UNORGANIZED hotel staff. The maintenance guy was the only person who was helpful, polite and welcoming. He came up the stairs after us and provided us with our (third) room key, rather than making us walk all the way back down the scary/unsafe stairs, so thank him for that.We finally got into our final room, which was definitely NOT worth $225 for one-night with a rude wake-up call lady pounding at our door. Oh and I almost forgot to let you all know, if you try to call the front desk from your room NO ONE WILL ANSWER.

This hotel has been my go-to hotel in Philly for a number of years but unfortunately has dramatically changed and is in serious need of an over haul. One of the major issues of the hotel is the overall deplorable attitude of the staff. It's not the entire staff but the majority. There is a blase attitude with the staff acting like they are inconvenienced for speaking to a hotel guest. There is a culture of 'what's in it for me' from the hotel staff rather than 'how can I serve the customer'. One of the major issues is filthiness throughout the breakfast area and the majority of the areas outside of your room. There are fruit flies throughout the breakfast area, overflowing garbage cans at the front entrance as well as the kitchen area, and the breakfast crew seems to make up their own hours, starting breakfast about 45 minutes to an hour later than the posted times. The pool area needs a good cleaning, it appears that they do pick up towels but that's about the extent. It needs a good cleaning and is not sanitary. The other issue is that the management or front desk seems to turn a blind eye or possibly encourage a guest check-in with a dozen children like it is a summer camp ostracizing the rest of the guests at the hotel. Also, there seems to be no security, meaning that people from the mall area walking through the hotel at their Leisure taking advantage of the Hotel amenities and potentially nefarious activities with management seeming to turn a blind eye. This is definitely a security issue for the hotel guests. Observe the front Hotel desk staff- anything from yawning aloud like it was their own living room to taking their back and scratching up against one of the corners of the walls like a grizzly bear. You simply can't make this stuff up. Very sad, unprofessional, no leadership or training. Will not stay at this hotel again until things are reconciled.",2017-12-18 16:43:12

With such blah moments, time after time the stays here we're a roller coaster of positives and negatives. For me, it was the convenient location for its proximity to where I attend at least a monthly business meeting. Secondly, the quality of the bar and food downstairs saved me a trip driving around town looking for a place to eat. As a bonus, my short stays allowed me to practice energy saving program promotions by placing a sign on my door signifying I did not need maid service the next morning. I received a $5 voucher and used it on my next visit at the restaurant downstairs towards my dinner. The following stay I did the same by placing the sign on my door and received nothing. I was in a hurry and didn't inquire about the voucher. The next stay, I received nothing again and felt this might have been an oversight. I thought I might just find a different place next time since the prices we're going up. I was again in a hurry so I didn't bring it up.

Not only that, we found multiple cigarette burns on the comforter! 

So the cleaning people didn't notice the comforter, did they even change the sheets? We went down to request another room and they had none. So we asked for another comforter and they had no spares. I asked if we would receive a discount and was told to contact the manager on Monday. We did, and they were no help. They tried to argue with me and tell me that even though I had evidence it hadn't been cleaned, that it had been cleaned properly. Wouldn't offer a discount, or a refund, or anything. The manager was EXTREMELY rude to me.",2018-12-12 19:56:05

Check-in was at 3pm, and driving up from DC on Memorial Day weekend takes a bit of time to say the least. We arrived at the hotel at 6pm to check-in and my mom met me outside and said the hotel called her to ask if I was coming. Multiple things wrong with this:

1. how did they know who my mom was? They had to have gone through the block reservation and look at the names. 
2. Why wouldn't they just call me instead? My phone number was the only number listed on the reservation I made. 
3. I'm 30 years old. I don't need a hotel calling my mom to ask her what I'm doing. 

This was extremely unprofessional. The front representative even told me to my face that she did this. Apparently, the hotel over booked and they needed to ""kick people out"". I guess I was targeted because I was checking in at 6pm instead of 3pm. Never knew that was an issue. 

It gets better still. Our stay was for two nights and I woke up after night one to a receipt says I was checked out. I called the front desk and they said I only had reservations for one night. This is false. I have a confirmation email stating the correct dates and Marriott customers service verified it in their system as well. I'm not saying the hotel is holding a grudge against me because I submitted a complaint after the first day, but if it walks like a duck, sounds like a duck, well...it's a duck. 0/10. Stay far away. It's ironic that we're next to Valley Forge because I would rather brave the winter with Washington's men than stay here again. 

P.S. I am still waiting to hear ANYTHING from the hotel or Customer Service about this matter. 

UPDATE: I spoke with customer service and they ""lost my complaint""(LOL right...). I finally got a case number and should have some results in 72 hour according to them. 

Update2: the front desk representative emailed me saying sorry (more or less). I think at this point after all that's happened a sorry email seems like a slap in the face.",2019-05-30 13:01:12

IHG hotels apparently partners up with 3rd party booking organizations like Priceline and hotelsbycity.com and then they say they have no control over how the 3rd party booking agents treat their customers.  In my case, I spent the time trying to book the room, finding out there are rooms available, entering my personal and credit card information, the card got processed, then they said, no rooms are available at the price we charge you.  Tried contacting the hotel directly again, got sent to an IHG call center.  IHG call center said the room would be 30 dollars more than the advertised price (is that bait and switch, especially after they had already run my card?).  IHG also told me they don't honor the best price guarantee they have on their website.  Spent almost 2 hours, 5 reps including 3 supervisors, only to be told they would not honor the price they had advertised and charged.  Three of the 5 were extremely rude and condescending.  My thought...if you make it difficult to contact the hotel directly and use 3rd parties that are not reputable, you are condoning their behavior.  As for the booking, never got it made, waiting to see if the credit card pending charge drops off or if they try forcing it through so I can do a charge back.

I called the front desk and the gentleman said he could move us down the hall 5 doors. I told him to please make sure before i awoke my son that this room was not in the same condition. He wasn't happy about doing so but supposedly did and brought the keys to the new room to us. My husband , myself and sons pack everything back up and begin to move rooms. We check the beds and this time a USED CONDOM was on the floor!!!!! I at this point am irate. I go to the front desk and he proceeds to apologize but this time as if I'm bothering him!

He says it's an upgrade and will not charge for the upgrade, which was a joke! The room had bed bugs and trash from quite some time ago under kitchen cabinet which black bugs we crawling to!

They said she'd be available Monday and this was Friday ! I had to sleep in our truck in 100* weather that night. I speak to Teracita the next morning, a front desk girl and she was the rudest woman ever! Said they will comp us that night, well I told her that is expected since we moved 3 rooms and didn't get to the 3rd till midnight! She said maids would be there to clean so we left the whole day to let them clean and came back to the same bed bugs plus some but the room was filled with air freshener!  I have reported them to health dept and called the holiday Inn corporate to report this matter. And the manager Nora finally called Saturday because corporate said she had to. She was worse than Teracita. Either they have not complied with laws regarding pest control or just have terrible maid service. Either way we will NEVER stay here again.

They were absolutely rude when it came to figuring out the mess that was caused by the block of rooms I had booked. I had people call in to claim a room and transfer that room from my credit card to their and have the room under their names.
That didn't happen.

A few hours later I come downstairs to resolve an issue with keys and instantly the male became accusatory and said it was my friend's fault that the issue was present. EVEN if it was indeed a customer error, it is rude and unprofessional to blame the customer about the issue. I came down simply to ask to resolve the issue which all it took was to reactivate my card. THAT'S ALL I wanted done.

I chose Travelodge for on-site parking, WiFi, and complimentary breakfast, pretty reasonable, right?

-Travelodge and Howard Johnson front desk in shared office (chaotic, unorganized, and long wait time for anything)
-excess dust, noise, and parking lot pavement was risky to park on
-breakfast from 6am-9am was completely out of food by 7am and not replenished, coffee was in main office(which was locked), and when front desk was notified they ignored us for an hour and then closed breakfast at 8am instead.

We arrived on a Saturday afternoon to find a parking lot and hotel entrance that are currently under construction. The entrance to the parking lot is just past the hotel itself and currently surrounded by a lot of orange construction fencing (as of July 2019). There was plenty of parking available, and when we checked in, the parking cost ($30/night) was added to our bill and our parking tickets were taken in exchange for hotel keys. 

Our room ""with a view"" overlooked the Benjamin Franklin Bridge and Cherry Street Pier, which was pretty nice. However, the trade-off is that we were bombarded with Columbus Street traffic noise all night, which was surprisingly loud (likely because it was a Saturday night, which I'm sure brought out the best in people...). It was a short 10 minute walk to be in the center of Old City, which was perfect for our needs.

Our queen beds were somewhat firm but overall fairly comfortable. The room was clean and stocked with a Keurig and several coffee options as well as the typical basic toiletries. It was a bit noisy throughout the night; our room was between the elevator and the stairs and likely got a decent amount of foot traffic. The free breakfast was typical --- mediocre omelets, bagels, cereals, yogurts, and beverages. The pancake machine was out of order at the time. There was plenty of seating despite the fact that we arrived at prime breakfast time on a Sunday morning.

The room looked clean but was in need of some serious dusting on the AC unit & the vent above the shower. The AC worked perfectly & the water pressure & temperature in the shower was great. We were in room 632, which is close to the elevator so it was a bit noisy during the day, not so much during the night. In the elevators, hall areas & bar area, there was an unpleasant odor.

The beds were comfy, we slept well during our stay, no real complaints with the beds, except that my bed linens had holes in them, but I wasn't too worried considering they looked & smelled clean. The restaurant prices & room service was a bit steep for me, so we used Uber Eats, which gave us variety & was cheaper than the hotel's restaurant prices. We only had two real complaints, even though we were guaranteed a late check out, housekeeping woke us up early (there was no do not disturb sign to put on the door) thinking we were checked out already, someone from the front desk knock on the door stating that we would be charged for another day if we stayed past 1pm & tried to hand me an envelope with the last name Jones on it, my last name isn't Jones so that was concerning.

I asked if he was sure because I didn't want to wake up in the morning to my car being towed away. He said that they monitor the parking for the motel and it would be fine. So after parking, my cousin and I walked up to my room and had my dinner. But I then realized I accidentally left my phone either in my car or the lobby.

So my cousin and I went down to check in my car and OUT OF NO WHERE a older man came running up to us screaming and cursing at us saying we better move the car or he was going to call the cops because we were parked in a handicap spot. I tried to explain to him calmly that I don't mind moving my car,but that we were authorized to park there by the front desk. But he continued to threaten me and scream. So at that point I moved my car and asked the front desk where I could park my car. He told me there was free parking across the street,and I was more then welcome to park in his spot(pointing to his red car just outside the lobby) when he was off work at 2 am. So I said ok,I will do that. I also asked if he picked up my phone off the counter when I checked in. And he said he didn't see any phone..i said I set it down right by the phone..but he said he didn't see it and he could check the security cameras and give me a call..well 1 hour later I didn't receive a call,so I decided to try the Find My IPhone app again,and it showed its location to be EXACTLY where the front desk guys car was parked.(remember he had pointed to his car earlier when he said I could take his spot?mmhmm)  so I called the cops,but they were extremely busy. So my cousin and I decided to go and ask him WHY the app is showing my phone to be in the exact location of his car. And why had he had not looked at the security footage. He just stared at me and didn't say anything for about 30 seconds and then said he he couldn't look at the security footage that night,but he had an idea on who might have taken my phone. So I told him it might be a good idea to call them otherwise I was going to have the police come down here and investigate for themselves. He said he would call and give me a call..well that never happened! So I called and he said that he was off work now,but I could call and talk to the manager in the morning.  So I called and talk to whomever was working the next morning and she told me that there was nothing they could do. They wouldn't review the security footage. And even after I told her about my suspicions with the front desk person,she told me it wasn't any of their employees and that I probably just dropped my phone or something. I asked about having a cop come and review the footage and she laughed and said that ""the cops won't come here for a stolen phone. They have only come and reviewed security footage one time before and that was for an Actual burglary"" ..at that point I just hung up because I was so furious.

When I asked for some at the desk, he would only give me 2, because housekeeping called in sick, again saying no one wants to work.  2 washcloths, for a family of 4.  We will absolutely never be staying here again, and would advise against it for anyone else.  Spend the extra money and stay somewhere else!",2021-05-18 17:45:25

That sounded good to us, so we arrived there and AGAIN, asked the working staff to confirm there was no pet fee and only the refundable deposit, again they said yes. After we left, we noticed that we did not get the deposit back, and our dogs had made no mess whatsoever, but they told us then over the phone it was a non-refundable deposit. Why then, did 2 separate employees tell us it was? We would NOT have stayed there knowing that. Our room was about $160 for the 1-night stay, and the pet fee was the same! On top of that, the hotel room was not clean, there were several hairs on the pillows and bedsheets indicating the sheets probably were not changed before we got there. The bathroom was sticky and it just didn't smell like it was cleaned. Had we known it was over $300 for a one night stay in a less than pleasant hotel, we would have steered clear! The elevator wasn't working properly either so we were waiting in front of the elevator for 15 minutes before being able to get into it. Overall a very, very poor experience. Steer clear if you have pets, or if you like having a clean hotel room. The manager was very rude to us as well. I would give it negative stars if I could.",2020-03-05 21:42:24

Secondly the heater in our room was not blowing hot air, only cold air so we were freezing! I called more than 6x to the front desk to ask about the issue and there was no answer. I walked down there and the lady was FaceTiming someone WITH HER MASK OFF (she didn't bother putting it on when I was speaking to her) *did not catch her name but she had a stud piercing above her lip* and told me to check the switch upstairs by the window. Well, I did that and it did not solve the problem. Once again I called to her 4x and NO ANSWER. Horrible service! We ended up sharing a room since their heater worked and it was crammed!

Had a ""Trap House"" feel.

Kudos to her for keeping her response professional. It was pretty much downhill from there. Our room was partially clean and was missing a few amenities, fridge was dirty, room smelled off and the outlets behind/beside the beds did not work. The housekeeping staff...you couldn't really tell if they walked in off the street or really worked there!! The talking loudly and doing nothing over performing their actual responsibilities was unfortunate. One guy was talking so incredibly loud, I opened the door and nicely asked him to move from in front of our door. Dude moved but is STILL talking loudly about BS...we called down to the front desk who informed us they can't do anything. He's talking to someone who isn't even supposed to be here. Can't? Or won't do anything? Won't is more like it. This place is SO noisy!!! They asked us to leave the property. The SAME man who was talking loudly came up to our room with his Pitbull trying to intimidate us with it, saying we threatened the girl at the front desk. Which we most certainly did not. They then overcharged my card, hung up on me when I asked for a manager, then yelled at me on the phone that she didn't have to explain anything to me!!

D0QB5dBN_yorXP0EKYlSLQ,RZWQgZthQhbkoDFeAcUC9w,wuw1WipH9fnr6pqrROv5dQ,3,4,14,2,"I stayed for one evening at the Hyatt House in May 2013.  I was ready to write a four-star review (one star off for some noise at night but then again I was on the ground floor) for the well-appointed rooms and friendly staff.  Overall a comfortable stay until I went to breakfast on Sunday morning, where I met Lou.  Here goes.. 

UPDATE 5/20:
1 star for Lou
5 stars for Natalie, the manager, who refunded my room charge and assured me all would be sorted out
Average = 3 stars. But read on anyway....

Time: 8:00 am
Place: Somewhere in Suburbia, PA

I'm not a morning person.  I need at least two cups of coffee before I can function.  And I was seeking out just that at the Hyatt House's complementary breakfast.  The hotel is friendly, inviting, and comfortable, and I was on the ground floor.  So I went to breakfast in a T-shirt, gym shorts, and socks.  I was toasting my muffin when I met Lou.  

Standing there with no hotel uniform, wearing an Under Armour athletic shirt, he rudely interrupted my toasting and coffee:

Lou: You need to put shoes on.
Me: Excuse me?
Lou: You need to put shoes on.  This is a food area.  You need to put shoes on now.
Me: I'm toasting my muffin.

I proceed to ignore Lou, wondering if he even works at the hotel given his attire, and continue with my coffee and muffin.  If he had asked me politely I likely would have complied.  But instead he talked to me like I was a child and patronized me.  Lou gets backup.  

One of Lou's henchmen pops out of the kitchen and tells me that I have to put shoes on and tells the omelette chef not to make me any food.  I speak to the front desk manager, describe Lou, and she tells me that anyone who works at the hotel would be in uniform.  All I have is dress shoes, which I'm not putting on with my comfortable clothing.  She tells me that just wearing socks is fine.  Back over to the breakfast area...

Lou: You need to put shoes on.
Me: Do you even work here?
Lou: Yes.
Me: Okay, well I just spoke to the front desk manager and she said I didn't need to put shoes on.  If she comes over here and tells me to put my shoes on, I will.
Lou's henchman: Hey if you have a problem with him, you have a problem with me.
Me: Fuck this.  

Lou brings his ass over to the manager and starts bitching.    The exchange continues.

Lou: This is a restaurant.
Me: It's the breakfast area of a hotel, this isn't brunch at the fucking Four Seasons.

Some other guest, surely from some paradise of suburban wasteland butts in:

Nosy guest: It is a restaurant.
Me: What? I don't have time for your shit. 

I take my breakfast to my room and pack up to leave.  Lou has ruined my appetite.  I return to the breakfast area to have a final word with him.  I ask one of the other servers to get Lou.  He hides in the kitchen like a little girl.  Speaking of little girls, there were three of them walking around barefoot in the serving area.  Where is Lou the shoe Nazi now?

I am a loyal Hilton traveler, but this weekend I tried this Hyatt.  Every time I stay at a Hilton brand I go to breakfast with only socks on.  That's how I walk around my apartment building.  It makes me comfortable.  Isn't that what hotels should do for you? Make you comfortable?  It looks like I won't be returning home to the Hyatt House.  

Too bad.  It's a nice hotel.  I would have liked to go back.  Lou is doing such a great job running the ""restaurant"".  Keep up the great fucking work, Lou.

UPDATE 5/20: If Lou does for some reason have a lot of free time on his hands in the future I would be happy to pay the tuition here for him:

Within a couple hours of us checking in, my friend found a bed bug and realized he had several bites all over his body.

We ended up sleeping in our truck since there was not a single available room in Reno (last day of Burning Man so the town was full) and at 8am went back to the front desk to speak to the manager who was incredibly rude and even accused us of bringing the bed bugs with us. 

Other than the bed bugs, the TV didn't work, the AC was broken, the shower kept switching between freezing cold and scalding hot, and the elevator makes you feel like you're on a low-budget version of the Tower of Terror. It should not even be legal for this place to remain open.

Pros:
Good location - relatively quiet (away from main street), close to gas station and a very good Chinese/Cajun restaurant called Crawfish
Plenty of parking
They sell beer in the lobby, along with other snacks

24 hour fitness gym located 15 minute drive away.

I didn't give 5 stars because the hotel could use a renovation to make the floors and walls look newer.
Also, I was rudely awakened by a crying baby in the middle of the night.  Would not stop crying for 15 minutes.  
I called the front desk and the guy asked me to be patient.  I called a 2nd time and he said he will take care of it and hung up on me.  He did take care of it, thank you sir!

She just blanked stared off. Mainteance man meets me upstairs now hes trying his key and its not working. At this point someone inside that room says hello,, Someone is in here! So NOW IM BEYOND PISSED!!So you gave me a key 3 different times to a room that was already occupied, and not at 1 time did you decide to look at your computer to see if it was already occupied. That's just CRAZY And simple minded to me. I go back down with mainteance he tells her its occupied, she stands there looking crazy AGAIN, Staring off... She then moves me to room 302..at this point we were just rushing to get out to the pool before it closed at 7pm,Dropped our stuff off and left back out, the 1st night we slept fine and was gone from the hotel most of the day. We returned around 5:30pm again that day , it was raining as we came in, I asked Kiri if it stops raining sometime soon will you guys open the pool back up ? She responded with if the PH Levels are fine we will open it back up, I said well when will you guys check that,its already 6:20..she responded with oh we'll just stay open later than 7 today. Ok GREAT! I Get the kids dressed in their bathing suits and we go back to sit in front of the building and wait for the ph to be tested so we can get in. We WAIT And We WAIT! By this time its now 7:20, i go back in and ask Kiri well what time will it be tested ? she responds with oh i'm waiting on Mainteance and he's off the property right now....OH REALLY? Now i feel like your playing with ME And my children!! So at this point my kids are upset, i'm upset...We just go back upstairs disappointed! Fast forward to about 10:30Pm that same night, Now ME AND MY HUSBAND Are on 1 bed..& our 2 kids are on another, well the bed that my kids were sleeping on just suddenly flips over to 1 side and my 1 yr old goes FLYING TO THE FLOOR!!!!

We arrived around 10 AM and planned to just park and head into the city, but when I went in to confirm with the front desk that it was okay to leave my vehicle prior to check-in, they informed me that they had rooms available, gave me the keys and allowed us into our room. Very impressed with that, and it was a precursor of a very nice stay. This is a pretty good property, as long as you come in with your expectations appropriately set.

 ***PROS*** -Very good location! There's very little in the immediate vicinity (although Cherry St. Pier is right across the street and D&B's is right down the road), but it's an easy 15-20 minute walk or a $10 Uber to Old City or a 10 minute to Penn's Landing. -Views! Be sure to pony up the few extra $$$s for a Riverview room. It's worth it! -Room condition. Our room was exactly what we expect from a HIE: clean, comfortable, plenty of room. Nothing fancy, but it delivers what it promises!

 ***CONS*** -It can get LOUD here. Half the rooms face I-95, the river view rooms face Columbus Boulevard. Staying on a Friday night, there were quite a few street races and ATVs blasting down the Boulevard off and on from about 10 PM all the way to 2-3 AM. Even on the 6th floor and with the sound machine that we travel with on, we were woken up several times. -Parking. At $30 a night, it's pricey for open lot parking. You DO get unlimited in-and-out privileges, but still. -Breakfast Buffet safety. It was nice to see a nearly fully stocked breakfast buffet again, but there were very little mitigation measures in place, and no one present to correct the guests who ignored what Was expected (several guests walking back up to the buffet maskless, touching items then putting them back, etc.). 

All in all, we enjoyed our stay here. It did exactly what we hoped it would do as a home base for some Old City sightseeing for a family. The noise was a significant issue, but there's very little that management can do about that. Bring a sound machine, some ear plugs and plenty of hand sanitizer (and maybe your own breakfast!), and I think you'll be pleased with your choice.",2021-11-14 20:58:28

We checked in about 8:00 PM on December 31st and the male employee on duty was horrendous.  He was rude and abrupt.  Later, while waiting for someone in the lobby, I watched and listened to him have a conversation on the phone at the front desk, in front of guests, dropping the f-bomb to god knows who.

Early the next morning, while I was grabbing a stale bagel and burned coffee, another guest, out of the blue, started engaging me about how awful the service was the night before.  Apparently, everyone noticed how unpleasant this man was.

The actual hotel felt rundown.  The room looked shabby and outdated.  The wall that the beds were against was, no joke, lined in mirrors- weeeeeird.  The Wifi didn't work and the TV was a grainy boxy thing from 1990s.

The bathtub was peeling paint everywhere which I have never seen in a hotel before. Around 2AM I woke to my daughter yelling because a man was entering our room through the window!

Surprisingly he didn't seem alarmed and walked to our room and secured our window. He explained that this problem had become worse during the course of the pandemic. I was wondering why, if they were aware of this problem, do they not check to make sure all the windows are secure. I was in tears. I would have loved to leave and go

Do you know what has been my #1 peeve about hotel stays? Thin walls and rude neighbors. The first night I stayed here I could hear every single song my neighbor was playing, every annoying commercial in between songs, every single conversation Mr. I LIKE TO YELL EVERYTHING I SAY was having on the phone and with others in the room, you might as well have no walls at all that's what it sounded like lol. I felt like I was living in my sh!tty apartment complex back in the day when I was in college. I could also hear every door slam from the entrance doors and occasional Zumba elephants (Phrase courtesy of Christie S) stomping down the halls. On the bright side(?), the loud A/C unit and bathroom air helped cover up some of the noise, and I had to turn on the TV to additionally cover up the noise next door so I could sleep. 

Luckily, the second night was so much quieter and I barely heard anything from our room. I read some reviews of people hearing airplanes overhead due to the proximity to the airport but strangely enough I didn't hear them at all while we stayed here.

The front desk attendant was friendly and speedy at checking us in, but was a bit too speedy because we didn't receive the free breakfast vouchers we were supposed to get. I didn't even know my hotel stay came with free breakfast had my friends staying in another room not mentioned it. It's continental style, served from 6-10 and includes make your own waffles, yogurt, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, various carbs (Bread, bagels), juice, milk and coffee. They do have soymilk in addition to regular milk but it's next to the oatmeal rather than at the coffee station for those that want milk alternatives in their coffee. There's a hot breakfast upgrade for $5 which looked like it had some sort of cooked eggs (Probably scrambled), bacon and sausage to name a few items.

The room we got itself came with a fridge, microwave, and small coffee maker. There's a small balcony on the 2nd floor rooms. Ours was overlooking the lawn and pool. The room is tiny and the bathroom even tinier. You can barely walk in and close the door to the bathroom. The bed was comfy at least.

The bathroom had quartz shower walls and countertops with good water pressure and the tub stopper had a few spots of rust but the actual tub was very clean.

There's not a lot of shopping or food options in the surrounding area due to its location. 

We chose this hotel mainly because we were headed further south the next day and the airport hotels were the closest places to stay that were in a major city. Due to the thin walls I'm not sure if I'd stay here again.",2018-04-02 16:38:51

If you'd like the deja-vu experience of walking through a CSI or Law & Order television set, come on by. If I were a location scout I would definitely pitch the four-story U-shaped building to the director/producers for some sort of crime investigation. All it's missing is a neglected pool, possibly with a floating corpse. 

That tongue-in-cheek comment aside, I was able to catch some much-needed shut eye here. I don't know if my neighbors were especially quiet or if the walls were in fact more than paper-thin, but with the small A/C unit going gently, I didn't hear a peep from the outside world. 

The room had a very subtle human urine scent to it but the sheets were bleach white clean. Mattresses were hard and cheap. The bathroom only had two hand towels and two face towels which was bizarre. Drying off with those tiny morsels while half-conscious and sea-legged was a comedic adventure. However, the room did come with an iron (?) and a coffee machine. 

Any claim to this place being 'remodeled' is totally bunk. I will leave it at that.

The wifi is unpredictable and you can't get it at all on the fourth floor so make sure to request a room on the second or third floor for connectivity.

Checking in was quite the scene, clumsily spear-headed by some old hippie dudes at the counter who were totally nice but utterly clueless about anything designed after 1980 (read as: hopeless with all computers and electronics). With two people ahead of me it took about 20 minutes just to get to the counter. 

Half the hotel is cordoned off as weekly live-in apartments. There are some characters around but were all totally friendly individuals. If I were a radio producer I would set up camp here just to hear people's life stories. 

We had a crap-ton of camping gear in my car so it was comforting to hear they do parking lot security checks a couple times a night. I wasn't too worried about it, but still...

So... if it's an experience you want, you can find one here. Bare-boned and worn-out, the rooms still give you what you need.",2015-07-25 20:23:44

When he came back instead of having a solution he made the situation worst by belittling us, telling us that we were wrong, that we were probably lying about booking a room, etc. His tone was demeaning and he even said ""I'm not giving you a reservation, in fact I'm not doing anything for you guys"" and walked away.

My fiancé took me here recently to pop the question ...so I all I see are hearts and champagne bubbles in my mind's eye when I think back on the evening. 

That said, this hotel is amazing! We stayed in a fantasy theme suite on the secret top level of the building, I didn't even know those kinds of rooms existed outside of the movies!  Each room was named and the door was decorated to reflect the theme (i.e. - Cleopatra's Tent, Atlantis, Leather & Lace...and one very cryptic door with no name just some 80's-fantastic computer imagery, Tron perhaps?) I was so intrigued by each one it took every ounce of willpower not to knock and beg to be allowed to see inside. 

Our suite was Gigi, a very ornate Loius XIV style of room.  Beautiful furniture, gorgeous chandeliers and a HUGE Jacuzzi in the room made for a very romantic evening. 

The staff was very attentive and helpful. We had originally planned at dining in one of the two restaurants but there was a youth conference also in residence and the place was overrun with teenagers, so the front desk suggested we have more intimate champagne dinner in our room and it was perfect.  

Everything was clean, nothing grossed me out and I checked.   And considering this section of rooms was basically designed for skeevy behavior that's pretty impressive. There are a couple of quirks associated with the fantasy suites. For maximum ""privacy"" there are no windows in the rooms and the elevator doesn't go to the top floor, you need to take the elevator to floor 14 and walk up one very small flight of stairs.  Which I guess makes sense; wouldn't want any unsuspecting kids stumbling into the adult playground.

All the furniture looked new, as did all the bathroom and kitchen fixtures.

Parking is free, which is a nice plus. Hotels near the university and downtown charge daily parking rates of $11-$20.

My 4th-floor suite at the Residence Inn-Williams Centre overlooked a new corporate park. It was pretty quiet, even though the guests across the hall from me had a dog (many Marriotts allows dogs for a nonrefundable fee). And we had quite a spread for breakfast: eggs, potatoes, bacon/sausage, french toast, hot/cold cereals, yogurt, fruit, muffins, coffee and three different kinds of juice. One can also make waffles.

One thought: While we had ceramic dishes and real flatware in our suites, at breakfast, we ate off of black styrofoam plates, with plastic cutlery. That's a lot to dump in a landfill at the end of the day. I wish Marriott would replace the plastic with real plates and cutlery to cut down on environmental damage.

The gym was narrow, but had room for several treadmills, an elliptical machine, and a decent variety of free weights. Gym hours are stated as 5 a.m. to 11 p.m., but if you're there at midnight to get in a 5-mile run at the end of a long work day, as I was one night, you won't get kicked out.

Staff is friendly and professional overall. The check-out clerk, without my asking, upgraded me from a studio to a one-bedroom suite at no charge. Always a nice way to get introduced to a hotel. Also, when I walked into my suite, housekeeping had already turned down my bed and turned on the clock radio to play jazz from the local NPR station.

Overall, I had an excellent stay here. The only caveat is that you're about 8 miles - or a 10-15 minute drive - to the university and downtown. But if you build in a little extra travel time for that, this hotel is hard to beat.",2008-05-30 17:36:07

When she finally acknowledged the fact that yes, I was in legitimate need of checking in she asked if I was a member of the Hilton Hhonors rewards program to which I said no. Most places would ask if you're interested in joining but, nope, she didn't even offer. I knew this was going to be a pricey stay, so of course I wanted to join and had to ask her if I could. She turned around to toss a gift bag with bottled waters and candy at me and muttered some welcome speech as quickly and quietly as she could. The gift bag was nice, she was not. Not a great first impression when you're introducing someone to your loyalty program.

The bell and valet boys were all very sweet and helpful. There was a lot of construction so the conference shuttles were almost impossible to see and they would always come in the lobby (it was freezing outside!) to tell the conference goers when they arrived.

My room was very large and spacious, but other than that lackluster. Standard hotel vibe that feels outdated because every hotel room in the past 15 years has looked identical. The breakfast was your typical hotel buffet style but I have to give a shout out to the super charming man that was working the omelet bar. Honestly, give that man a raise! He is so sweet and puts everyone in his (never ending) line in such a great mood for the rest of the day. He exudes happiness. I also appreciated that they had a non-dairy milk alternative because that is SO HARD to find at hotels.

All and all, it's just another hotel. You're paying mostly for location, but if I'm paying $1200 for 3 nights I'd probably search elsewhere. (If you do stay here I hope you get to meet Mr. OmeletMan at least!)",2016-11-29 23:48:59

When we went for our tasting, the first of 2-which I will get to in a minute, I relayed that I am allergic to strawberries and they could not be near our food.  When the plates came out there was a strawberry on every plate, when I reminded Lindsay (our new coordinator) of the note, she said that there was no such thing and pretty much oh well.  I ate what I could and then had to relay on my party to tell me how the rest was.  When our main meal came out it was inedible.  We were originally going to go with a buffet and changed due to this horrible food.  The next tasting (which they were going to charge me for, and I fought hard not to be due to their mistake) went much smoother.  The food was better, but we still did not choose a beef as it was NASTY!  

Responsiveness:  If you think calling is a better way to communicate than email then this is the wrong venue for you.  I would call and it would take DAYS to get back to me, but an email would be answered in 24 hours.  I am old school and would much rather hear your words than read them.  There was always a bitchy undertone in an email, almost every email mind you.  

Professionalism: We were served the wrong champagne at our wedding, even though I had picked out a certain one, told it would be there and found out last minute that it never was ordered.  I had paid for that champagne and have yet to see any money be returned for that.  Second, our matre de was a rude gentleman who gave attitude with every request.  I am sorry sir, but your job is to make sure the bride and groom are happy-this was not the case!  He disappeared for an hour.

z6gbwvM9GsgfLC2GvQo6dw,j3PmBXV8Gp8kwGITHCGSUg,Kg0gJ_3lGToLjuXrLY12Ng,4,0,0,0,"Just enjoyed the 4th of July at this hotel and it was nothing short of amazing...after we got checked in.

We booked our room through the 1-800 central number, we requested to book a firework view room, were given the price and paid in full to guarantee it. 

Well when we arrived we were told it was a $200 upgrade fee for a firework view room. Turns out that central reservations booked us in a city view room and requested firework view in notes only. What we needed was a park view room. 

Long story short, I was at front desk over an hour speaking (on the phone, they didn't even come down to personally speak to me) to Managers Miriam (I think that's her name it started with an M) and Al who were both rude and un-accommodating. 

We are on a 24 day road trip only staying at Hilton properties(when available) and I am a Hilton Honors member. I am appalled at the lack of respect and the un-professionalism by both of them...Al especially. (Who supposedly is her supervisor.) I will be speaking with Hilton about this.

Al passed the buck and said the only way I was getting a firework view room at no addl. charge is if I speak to a manager at the call center and they do it. 

I was on the phone with them forever and the call center manager called Al directly. While I was on hold, the front desk manager finally had some mercy as my kids are saying they are hungry and why couldn't we get lunch, she told me to hang up and gave me a partial firework view room at the price I pre-paid. 

The room was beautiful, huge living room with full kitchen, balcony, king bed, fold out couch which kids slept on. Room view wasn't full firework view, we had to go on balcony and look to side but that was fine. 

The managers reception was amazing. Full bar with cocktails, wine, beer, and soda. (We got our money's worth both nights, it was unlimited for 2 hours) On the 4th they went BIG and did a whole kids station with cherry coke and Shirley temples, juice boxes and water. They had fresh baked pretzels, chips/salsa, veggies/ranch, and a candy bar with m&m's and sour patch kids! Amazing...and the managers walked around and greeted, they were so friendly!

I never did see Miriam or Al(thank goodness because I was going to tell them just how disrespected I felt.)

The breakfast was also amazing. Everything you could imagine, it was like being at a full service resturant brunch. It was served inside the attached TGI Fridays. 

All in all this was the perfect hotel to stay in for 4th of July in Philadelphia and had we been quoted $450 for a firework view room, we would have paid it and still felt it was a good value(considering the managers reception and full breakfast each day for a family of 4!)

Just one piece of advice, for this location always book through hotel directly, so you don't get the shady upsell charge at check in.",2014-07-05 16:47:12

It's conveniently located next to I think about 3 bus stops - the 44 takes you downtown to the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, Reading Terminal Market, Mutter Museum, etc. About a 20-30 minute ride.

There is parking outside the hotel on the street and we didn't have to fight for a spot either. If there aren't spaces there, there's a $5 parking lot down the street. There's free breakfast and dinner. It's not GREAT food, but it's decent enough if you're too lazy to go out and get something. There's a business center that's free for you to print and do other things. We also went swimming in the pool in the Hilton next door, which is connected on the second floor where the gym is too. The pool is chlorine filled, but a good time if you have nothing better to do.

Pros:
Location (the convention center is right across the street, on the same block as Reading Terminal Market, and most attractions are within 10 blocks walking distance)
Friendly staff
Decent sized rooms
Fairly clean and modern (if ascetic) bathrooms
Room had a microwave, K cup machine and empty minifridge

Cons:
My room overlooked the Greyhound bus depot (south facing). I heard honking and beeping and announcements all through each of the 4 nights I stayed here
The walls are very thin. I heard my neighbor's snoring through 2 nights.
Room service (i.e. cleaning) was variable--one day my room wasn't cleaned yet when I returned at 2pm. Another morning I awoke at 6am to realize that a) they didn't replace the coffee, and b) they didn't replace the shampoo. This did not make me happy since I had a 7am business meeting.
Location is also a con, as this hotel is on the border with Chinatown and feels a little unsavory at night if you walk out the west exit.

We got a king suite. The room was clean. It has a  fridge, microwave, hot tub, tv, comfortable bed with clean sheets/comforter( see photos) Nice spacious area for the suite.
The Bathroom was a major problem.
For starters- the hot tub doesn't work (see photo)
We wasted 30 min trying to figure it out and gave up trying to turn it on and  when i called front desk  they said none are working due to remodeling, but they still have instructions on door and no sign stating that the hot tub doesn't work.
The bathroom very dimly lit. shower is darker than most closets. no light inside bathtub. Two out of the six light bulbs were not working (see photo)
Bathroom sink fixture knobs  were on completely backwards. It was very annoying(See photo)
Bathroom wallpaper a little dated(see photo)
No  bathroom. ventilation which is a huge problem which could not control any odors. I was surprised that the wallpaper wasn't all coming off from the moisture. That could cause potential health issues with mold allergies.
The customer service seemed to have gone downhill
For starters when I called the front desk and ask for towels, I was put on hold for  10 min after I started to mention how many I would like. I finally gave up and called back , the front desk  gave an attitude like ""Yeah you were telling that long list of what you wanted....."" Needless to say he was a bit rude. When he finally took the order on how many towels( and types I needed) The housekeeping showed up at my room. When I knocked on the door, I was greeted by a housekeeper that wasn't polite or chipper. She seemed like this was a bother and she acted like she wasn't interested in being courteous. She sure perked up after I gave her a tip though. 
As I experienced last year the TV volume is  still set maximum of ""15""  which is too low to hear - and even harder the AC/Heat is. I think they do this because of thin walls? Well what's the point of a television if you cannot hear it! Its not very fair at all to the guests, especially my gf who is hard of hearing.  And its so far away from the bed that you would need to sit up close to hear anything. It ruins the experience.
The Best Western needs a lot of work for it to be recommended.
The gala has its own problems
Too many people to a table ( 12 for only a 6 footer) No where to put anything. We were all bumping into each others elbows. Too many place/glasses and nowhere to put anything else. The band was great( Midnight Hour) but I noticed there were 2 tables at the front close to the speakers. It might have been a bad experience for them being so close to them( hello ? tinnitus?)I hope I never get seated there if I come back. The dinner was served a bit too late and the filet mingons were all not well done( I had to ask for them to fix that)
Also , I know people who work in catering and they left too many dirty plates and dishes during the gala. It was dirty dishes everywhere in the lobby where the bar is. That wouldn't have happened anywhere else

When she asked to see proof of that policy in their handbook, no one could supply it.

The staff was very rude and condescending to her when she was trying to figure out where she was going to go with all of her bags in the middle of a snowstorm. They gave away her room without even bothering to re-run her card. The Hilton Honors rep we spoke to was mortified and even stated that the ""policy"" they touted was non-existent.

I arrived at the hotel at 2AM in the morning and spoke to the Front Desk attendant (Terria Williams) - I apologize for publishing her name, but I was really annoyed by her and I hope by identifying Ms. Williams maybe the Hotel would offer her a Customer Service rehabilitation/ remedial programme so she would not ill treat her next Hotel guests!   

Immediately after informing her that I am checking in and giving her my last name, I asked if I had access to the ""Club Lounge"" area because I had made the reservation on Hotels.com and they mentioned that the Club Suites do have access to the Lounge area.  Thereupon, I believe without looking properly at my room check-in details, she went on to say it's only available for SPG members and that I do not have access.  I told her about my Hotels.com reservation and upon hearing this, she immediately became rude, belligerent, patronizing and downright MEAN!

She told me not to get smart with her and that she would not offer me any rooms! I told her I had already prepaid for my room and simply wanted to know about the club access.  She had  a side conversation with a Security Guard who was standing by the side and said something to the effect of ""I can't stand these people and it's a full moon outside too"".  I don't understand what the relevance between having a civil conversation with an adult and the moon being outside means? Also her reference of ""these people"" came off as a subtle racist remark!  Even the Security Guard looked at me and shook his head as if to say ""Don't listen to what she has to say, just ignore her"".

I told her it's 2 AM in the morning and I would just like my room key now.  She just laid it on the table and didn't say anything else.

When we came into our room we were surprised cause we felt it was very dirty. All mirrors and windows had stains, shower doors, shower tub itself, remote control was greasy and nasty, microwave was extremely dirty inside, coffee maker was all stained, tv stand had some white dirt on it - almost everything. 

We had a long drive to this hotel (it was about 8 pm already) and were very tired. Instead of getting rest, we had to deal with this mess in our room. We called to reception, explained and asked can they help us somehow, cause its not how we feel our room should be like. The answer was: ''It's okay, it happens sometimes!''. Needless to say, we were unhappy with a rude and unacceptable  answer like that.

We called to Hyatt customer service, they told us to talk to this rude receptionist again (seriously?) and then the call was disconnected. 

Since the hotel manager didn't care and refused to help and the customer service was unhelpful as well we decided to check out right away and never come back again. 

PS We had a good experience with many other Hyatts and never seen the room so dirty and the manager so rude.",2016-08-22 16:24:04
eB0Ai_0pXjp42VKJvzwSmQ,70z_7qMQ34iS-IHfm1QZyA,Kg0gJ_3lGToLjuXrLY12Ng,1,0,0,0,"Part 1- I made the Manager aware that not only was I going to write multiple reviews on my hotel stay, but that I will also write a formal letter to Hilton's corporate headquarters as well.  There is a reason that this hotel is so much cheaper than all of the other hotels in the area; not only is the staff ridiculously rude, but the property has many flaws as well.
When you check into the hotel, be prepared for a wait.  At peak check in time, after work hours on a Friday, I waited about 20 minutes to get to a front desk agent.  When I finally got to an agent, they could not see my name in the system.  Now, in the hotels defense, my husband did make the reservations, HOWEVER, my husband took the extra time to add my name to the reservation, because we were not traveling together.  Unfortunately, there is a flaw in THEIR system, when a person adds a name to the reservation, Embassy suites 800 reservation line can see the added name, but the hotel cannot.  So the system does not transfer all of the information from the online reservation to the actual hotel that you are staying at.  The craziest part about this FLAW in THEIR system, is that I called to confirm that my name was indeed on the reservation, along with my husbands, days prior to checking in.  After speaking to the manager, ""they did me a favor,"" which I was told several times throughout my stay by a cocky night manager (female- You're ONLY a hotel manager...), and checked me into the room.  Again, in their defense... FLAW in the system, to which someone higher up the chain is probably responsible for fixing.  Why would the systems (online reservations, the actual hotel system, and the 800 reservation line) not coincide with one another??  I'm a woman of progress... it's a flaw in YOUR system, not the customers problem... fix it!  At the very least, call the 800 # to confirm; they would not do this, as it was not their policy.  God forbid they use the time that they are getting paid to dial their main reservation 800 number in order to check-in a guest, which they are inconveniencing.
I get to my room, and it reeked of potent marijuana smell, by that time, after a 12 hour travel day, I simply laid down and took a nap.  I left the patio door open, in hopes of airing out of the room.  I was awakened by my husband who finally got to the room about an hour later and we went out for dinner.  We had reservations and were pressed for time, the room had aired out pretty well, so rather than make another complaint, and we simply went to dinner.  When we returned, I suppose the group above us had begun smoking marijuana again; I went downstairs and told the desk there was a potent weed smell in our room.  I have allergies, my husband is asthmatic.  They offered for us to switch rooms, but I declined; knowing that my husband had already changed over and would be asleep by the time I returned to the room.  The hotel attendant also mentioned several times ""Well, it's a smoking floor above you so...""   I was confused by her statement, so it's a smoking floor, so they're allowed to smoke weed?  I was in disbelief that she was that dense.  Also!; They ought to tell families if they are putting them immediately beneath the smoking floors; All of the ventilation systems are connected, so clearly the closer you are to the smoking floors, the more potent smoke smell will be, no matter what kind (weed, cigarettes).  It should be mentioned as a common courtesy to their guests, so that at that time, as they are checking in they have a chance to switch rooms.  I DON'T want to smell smoke, and as a nonsmoker I should have the choice not to!  As I was talking to the front desk attendant, security came over and was listening to my gripe; I finished, there was not resolution, so I simply walked to the elevator to wait to go up (The elevators are a nightmare, they only have 3 of them, 1 of them was not even working, and you can easily be waiting 10 minutes for 1, because they are so small).  As I was waiting for my elevator the security guard and front desk attendant looked over at me and he started chuckling, so I went back over and asked, ""Do you think my complaint is funny?; Is it funny to you that I have to smell weed all night? I want to see a manager.""  The manager came out, (the one who made it her business to tell me that they did me a courtesy by checking me into my hotel earlier) and asked what happened.  As I was talking to her, the front desk attendant chimes in and says ""we weren't laughing at her"", to which my reply was Bulls*it.  So naturally the manager at that point wanted to make the whole conversation about me saying the word BS, rather than the weed smoking nonsense, disrespectful security guard.  I simply told her, ""You get what you give in this world.""  His response was to laugh at my complaint and be disrespectful, and the hotel attendant's response was to interrupt as I was talking to a manager, and my response was to call it like I see it .... BS!",2016-08-21 00:24:41
SYZMsQIrolfzmVdkPhJ4PA,HGrnzSz6zjOO4LwgfpbEnQ,HAXqgsSigoTyfwaiK-MThw,1,0,0,0,"I had reservations for a two-night stay that I had made through the Wyndham website. At no time was it referenced that the hotel was currently undergoing a renovation. After check-in, we walked down the hallway to our room that was littered with spilled paint on the carpet, large drops of sheetrock texture and the room numbers literally affixed to the doors with blue painters tape.

Upon entering our room, it was unclean and ridiculously hot. So hot that the air conditioner couldnt get it cooled down to a level suitable for sleeping. It was clear that the management didnt want to spend the money to have the rooms prepared at a comfortable temperature for their guests. We requested another room and were given one on the third floor. Same story; dirty hallway and hot room. On our way back to the front desk to check out, we ran into a nice couple that were also having issues with the hotel. We all went back to the front desk and were told that management would be made aware of the issues but he couldnt process a reversal of charges for our room and that we would need to come by the next day to speak with someone. Although he was generally pleasant, he was clearly overwhelmed and understaffed. Fortunately we were able to find other superior accommodations nearby. 

The next morning my wife stopped by to make sure the charges were removed for our dismal experience. She was treated rudely by the woman at the front desk who refused any correction or even offer the slightest apology for all of the inconvenience this dump had put us through the previous night. Unbelievable. We are now cancelling the charge through our bank (yes, this Baymont charged us for TWO nights after we cancelled), reporting the experience to Wyndham and letting everyone we know to avoid this place like the plague...

Anyone that has given this place a positive review really needs to get out and try the numerous other hotels and resorts in Tucson and see the difference. Four stars? No way... If you need to stay by the Tucson airport for an early flight (like we did), do NOT bother with this place; there are much better (and similarly priced) options nearby.

She asked me for my ID and credit card, after fumbling for a minute I found my passport and couldn't locate my credit card valet. I was freaking out and asked her if she could take cash or charge the card on file. She told me she had to have the credit card (understandable) and that she did not take cash. I stepped away for a moment and phoned my friend who located my credit card valet 2 hours away in NYC. After visions of me sleeping on a park bench in Philly pranced through my head, she told me that she could take the cash with a deposit. That was just fine with me. I totally understood that. But the check in process was painful, then she kept saying things to me about having to take cash and how it annoyed her. 

The breakfast was sub par for an Embassy. The bar items were cold and the omlette was on the greasy side. 

The day hotel staff was much more friendly. However, the front desk clerk gave walking directions through a rather shady part of town. 

The location is great. The rooms are roomy. It was only a 10 dollar ride to the airport via shuttle bus, only 3 more dollars than the train from a 1970's horror movie.

The beds are comfortable, the rooms are large, the relaxing pool, and the hotel is quiet, with only 20 rooms on each floor.  Other than that there is so much that is so wrong, it is hard to know where to start.  
Safety.  Two of Three elevators were out of order most of the 5 days, 4 nights we were there.  Had there been an emergency, it would have been impossible to evacuate the hotel without accidents.    It was most inconvenient, time consuming and frustrating.  Hotel staff were well aware - I questioned the malfunctions several times; nothing was done to fix this while we were there.   With only one elevator working it took an hour to check out.   With no AC vents in the hallways, and 100 degree temperatures outside, it was hot and sticky waiting to catch the one elevator that was working. 
Front Desk. Not helpful or friendly. When I asked for an hour extension to checkout, I was initially told alright. But that representative was reprimanded and overruled by the Front Desk Manager who told me the hotel was expecting 200 people to check in the next day.  Hmmm. Isn't the next day -- tomorrow? Or 24 -30 hours from then?  She was just rude.
Venue. Most of conference facilities are located on the lower lobby.  People attending meetings had large, heavy, cumbersome equipment and large instruments, which required rollers or carts.  With only one elevator, very few people could manage the stairs; the meeting schedule had to be adjusted while people tried to deal with trying to catch the one working elevator.   Additionally, some people had to get a hotel employee escort them through the lower level back kitchen hallways to get to the assigned venue where the hotel had planned our event. That was time consuming and challenging.
Tasteless Food.  The primary restaurant is closed for renovation. There were no other choices except to walk to the Casino, not that far, but inconvenient and for mediocre food.  The food that came with the banquets and conference events was terrible.  Overcooked, dry meat, soggy roasted potatoes and mushy canned green beans.  Pathetic.

In all, it was OK but I was a bit disappointed, especially for the cost. The front desk staff was friendly enough, and my room was OK (but just OK). It did feel a little like you were in a cheaper hotel than a Hitlon-owned property. So here's the good, the bad and the ugly.

First of all, do not be confused. The Homewood Suites is next to the Hilton. You can't really see it from the road when you first turn. It is conveniently located near a number of restaurants and retail stores. I liked the convenience of things since I was staying so long. But it is in a pretty traffic-heavy area of the city and not the easiest to navigate, so beware. Unfortunately, I did feel a bit like a second-class citizen. The Hilton is clearly a much better maintained property. Things at the Homewood seemed dated and just slightly not kept up properly. I particularly disliked that you had to take a bit of a walk through a connecting tunnel to get to the pool or the fitness center, which were in the Hilton and not the Homewood.

Second, the thing I hated the most about my stay was the parking situation. At first, I figured I'd valet park. But I accidentally pulled into the Hilton instead of the Homewood Suites. Once we figured out that I belonged next door, the sky captain was kind enough and very patient while he walked me over to the Homewood and waited for me to check in. But that was the extend of my good experiences parking. They have this weird text message system for the valet here. I was told to text to get my car. The person took my car to the Hilton and had to be paged back to the Homewood. Then she told me curtly that I should specify that I'm at the Homewood. I gave up and decided to self park, which is a bit of a pain. You have to remember to get your ticket validated each time you want to leave, and the parking lot is a bit of a hike. On my final night, a valet employee stopped to yell at us that we were parking in the wrong part of the very expansive parking lot. No one told us there were designated areas and we were there for a week and a half. The parking attendants with the exception of that bell captain were all rude and bossy.

My room itself was fine, though again, it felt a bit dated in furniture and style. The bed was comfortable at least. It had a small kitchenette with a full sized fridge, which was great. But there were some things that made no sense. I had plates, cups, glasses and mugs but no silverware. The desk had absolutely no paper anywhere - no little notepad, no envelope. I had to go buy a notebook. And the TV had some sort of weird thing going on with it where every time I turned it off with the remote, the next day I couldn't get the cable signal back without calling maintenance. On day four they finally replaced the TV in my room, after which it was fine.

The front desk staff was a highlight. They were all very nice and answered all of my questions.

Would I stay here again? Maybe but probably not. I would book elsewhere or at the Hilton.",2019-06-18 02:59:45

Then the next morning our microwave in the room started beeping at 7 am, and we couldn't turn it off because none of the buttons worked - so we had to unplug it. I had to walk down to the lobby because we needed something from the car but the elevator wasn't working nor was any of the power in the building. I had to walk down the stairwell and I have a fear of stair wells which is besides the point but it was pitch black and honestly I was not okay - when I got to the front desk almost out of breath because I was having a dang panic attack over this the guy said ""oh we cut the power off because we're fixing it"" which ... is fine but why wouldn't you at least give your guests a heads up? But it was fine we went about our day after not having any hot water, electricity or A/C - when we came back everything was fixed (power wise) but none of our sheets were changed or towels replaced. It was super upsetting especially after that past morning the maintenance lady going through and knocking on every door saying she was going to clean. 
But we decided just to go to bed and get ready and leave the next morning. After trying to put all the sheets up on the bed just to pick up the room in an effort to help them I found that they didn't even have proper sheets on the bed - it wasn't fitted at all it was just two top sheets. Very strange - but now we're on the road again and honestly I'm just happy we didn't have to sleep in the car.",2019-04-07 16:12:52

1. Our hotel room was not clean upon our arrival. There were remnants of our previous guest scattered throughout the room
2. During our 4 night stay, our room was only ""properly cleaned"" twice
3. My brand new Macbook laptop and my colleague's Macbook charger was stolen
4. My colleague was charged for overnight parking during the stay. We flew to Philadelphia and did not have a car with her.
--------
I recently stayed at this hotel for four night for a conference nearby. There were a total of four of us, staying in two separate rooms for said conference. 

1. During our first night in the room, my colleague grabbed the ice bucket to fill it up with ice and found jello shots from the previous guests at the bottom of ice bucket. She immediately reported the event to the front desk. They apologized and assured her that it would be cleaned. The next day, when returned from our conference sessions, not only did we find that the jello shot at the bottom of the ice bucket had not been removed, but we also found additional items in the fridge. She, once again, reported the items to the front desk and and the manager on site. The objects were finally removed before our third night. However, when we were packing to leave, my colleague found two empty jello shot containers underneath her bed. 
2. In addition to the negligent cleaning performed the hotel staff prior to our arrival, our room was only fully cleaned twice during our 4 night stay. Our room was completely skipped on night,and another they cleaned and removed the used towels, but failed to replace them.
3. The fact that my almost $2,000 dollars worth of technology was stolen from a room that I paid to be secure is unacceptable. While I will not go into full detail, the fact remains that I entered this hotel with my laptop to use for onsite work and networking, and I left the hotel room without one due to their disrespectful, violating staff. Because their insurance company, Liberty Mutual, was unable to find evidence of ""negligence and liability"", my stolen laptop will not be replaced. And from reading previous reviews, my theft is not the first one that occurred on this property recently. 
4. My group is based out of North Carolina, so we all flew to Philadelphia and use Lyft/Uber for all of our transportation. Therefore, it was interesting that she was charged for four nights of overnight parking. She did not have a car on site. 

This stay certainly ranks as one of the worse hotel stays I have ever experienced. While the staff was tolerable, the accommodations and amenities were subpar. I would have been willing to look over the cleanliness lapses and charges, but the theft is not something to be taken lightly. And apparently, my theft was not the sole story from this facility. There are some serious issues regarding communication, cleanliness and security at the Embassy Suites - Philadelphia Center City. Do not book this hotel.",2017-08-04 13:27:26

Sunday, I arrived at 11:30am and asked for Early Check-in, they advised the hotel was sold out the evening before and early check-in was not available.  The representative put me on a waiting list in case anything became available before check-in time.  I left my belongings and did some sight-seeing.  Returned at approximately 2:30pm; I asked if there my reservation was ready, the same representative assigned me a room, different from what I had originally requested.  I originally request 10th floor and she gave me 9th floor because the room I requested was not ready yet.  I asked if I wait the remaining 25 minutes, will my room be ready, she said she cannot guarantee it, most likely not.  I said well, go ahead and book me.  She then charged the full amount of the room, plus deposit and taxes all in one swoop.  I complained about this room fiasco on the mobile app and they stood by their ""we can only guarantee a reservation at 3pm"" basically too bad, so sad.   I also had requested an upgrade package from their ""Drinks and Snacks"" in my room and it was completely ignored when asked on the mobile site two times. 

Monday morning, I leave my room at 8:00am and return at 3:00pm, I was running late and left shirt sale tags on the floor along with my towels from the shower.  I returned at 3pm and my room had not been cleaned or refilled.  I mentioned it on the online mobile app, and they said, sorry, we will address it.  I left on Tuesday morning at 7:45am and returned at 3:00pm and the room was not cleaned.  I left another message and someone contacts me to address the concern.  I declined them to come by since I was going to stay in the hotel and I didn't want them to come by when I was in the room.

I get a call from Tania late Tuesday afternoon, the Front Desk leader and was asked how can if they can give me a few additional bonus points or have some dinner on them ... I said, no thank you, I gave up on attempting to make this a pleasant experience with the several missed opportunities. 

I had not ever experienced such disregard to customer service at a Hilton chain hotel.  All they could say is sorry for the inconvenience and we take take your comments to address to our team so it doesn't happen again ... This hotel was an overflow hotel for a conference at about $270 a night ... plus applicable taxes and fees.

I came for the NFL draft which I knew would make the hotel ultra busy and I was right. Since I have the Hilton app I checked in online. I arrived at the hotel at 12:30pm, several hours before the 4pm check in time. I didn't mind waiting for my room, what I did mind was the rudeness of the front desk lady. I was completely dismissed and talked to like I was an idiot when I simply asked if there was any chance I could fully check in even though I told her I knew it was an extremely long shot. I then handed my bags over to the bellman and took my claim ticket. I left to grab lunch. Upon arriving back at the hotel I took a seat in the lobby with the 30 other people waiting to check in. As I waited I saw more and more people get the keys to their room. When I finally went back up to the desk to inquire about my room I was told it wasn't ready, this was at 3pm. I went and sat back down just as my app alerted me my digital key was ready. I went to the bellman to retrieve my bags. I was brought out my two small bags but my larger bag was not found. After 20 mins of searching they realized it had a different ticket number of which I wasn't given. The only reason I received my bag was because it still had my information on the tag from the airline. 

After the checking in fiasco the next day was easy going except for the horrible smell of cigarettes of which I am allergic. When housekeeping cleaned my room however they took my washcloths, including the one I had hanging up, and wasn't given freash ones. Thankfully I have my own sea sponge. 

On my third day here, and on day three of a migraine due to the smoke from other rooms, I complained to the front desk about the smell. I was told there was nothing they could do. Mind you the smell wasn't outside on my balcony but only in my room coming from the hallway area, leading me to believe someone was chain smoking in their room.

First of all, the line to valet your car was horrendous. We were sitting in the ""driveway"" of the valet line for at least 10 minutes. I had to get out of my car to ask someone to valet my car. (note: the people who valet your car are wearing casual clothes, so you have no idea who actual works at the hotel).

After the valet mess, we finally get in the long check in line, which is pretty inefficient. It's 2017, why can't we check in from an app? After waiting 20 min in this line, we get our rooms keys. The room itself, was okay. Our toilet or shower flooded...I am not even sure but there was tons of water on the ground after each shower use.

Also, the hotel staff was really awful. I remember coming back from the festival, and trying to use the bathroom on the first floor. The man working at the hotel basically harassed me for a wristband and told me I was ""making his job difficult"", I am not sure what's so challenging about unlocking a bathroom door? I also asked the front desk receptionist if I could purchase a bottle of water. He rudely told me they were fixing the floor and he was unable to get water. I just think that's such poor customer service. Why would they have floor issues during a busy music festival? Seems like poor management...

The complimentary breakfast was gross and unpleasant.

Immediately, my husband suspected bed bugs and lifted up the sheets to find prior blood speck stains on the mattress. We contacted the concierge who connected us with Patty the housekeeping manager. Patty sent a technician up to examine the bed. The technician would not rule out that there were bed bugs because he felt the blood specks on the mattress looked fresher than we initially thought. We checked beds in both rooms and found the same blood stain specks on both mattresses. We had to contain the stuffed animal which I slept with and the clothing which we wore in plastic bags.

After arriving home I proceeded to unpack the items (stuffed animal, shirt, shorts, undergarments from previous night) to be washed in the laundry and that's when our suspicions were confirmed. I found a small bed bug on the clothing and have contained it in a plastic medicine bottle.

This was the only time I had not read hotel reviews before booking and I deeply regret it. First off, the front desk staff is VERY unprofessional. I was in the middle of checking in when the girl working the counter rudely interrupted the process to have a 5 minute conversation with her coworker about chips. That's right, CHIPS. Furthermore, I had to come back within 5 minutes to change rooms as the NON-SMOKING room they gave me reeked of smoke and the bathroom light did not work. The second room they gave me was not much better. The shower barely worked (I ended up not showering because it was so gross). Seat was stained and carpet was definitely not clean either. This room also reeked of smoke.The bed sheets had an odd smell to them and were stained (I found a bug crawling around on them in the morning). In fact the entire night I kept waking up, hopeful that it was time to leave. Honestly, would have preferred to throw a sleeping back under a tree if I had one. Charging over $100 is a complete rip-off. I would not stay here again if it were free. PLEASE please save yourself the stress and trouble and book a stay somewhere else.",2019-09-29 17:02:18

Nothing was bad enough to warrant changing hotels, but I did not enjoy my stay here. The long and short of it:

1. Rooms. First off, everything (not just the rooms) has a certain smell to it. I'm not sure if this is just the air in PA, but it's noticeable. This off-putting start lead to my next discovery, the windows don't open, making sure the smell was going to be a permanent part of my stay. The fact that the windows were bolted shut lead me to crank up the AC, which I was less than happy to discover was loud and only mildly effective. The room itself (aside from all of this) was your standard room, with a smaller desk than most chain hotels. All things considered, I was less than happy.

2. Gym. The gym here is as small as you may expect, but it was obvious it had been neglected and forgotten. The area itself was messy, with trash in the corners and dust on some of the equipment. The equipment included a set of weights, 3 treadmills (only 1 fully working), 2 ellipticals and a stationary bike. All equipment seemed on the older side. There were 3 TVs which was nice? Seemed excessive for the space. Overall I was happy the gym was there, but it could definitely use some work.

3. Service. Check in/out went about as smoothly as expected, and the people at the front desk seemed friendly enough. My issue was that I was there for 4 nights, and they turned my room down for 3. Maybe a bit knit-picky but I don't think it's too much to expect that your room get turned down every day. Nothing ruins a hotel stay like coming home to an unmade bed and running out of towels.

4. Bar. As far as cheap hotel bars go, Holiday Inn Lansdale has a pretty entertaining one. The drinks are overpriced and the food is decent but expensive, but there's a group of locals that gather there that couldn't be more fun to grab a drink with. Would recommend diving in if you're here over the weekend.

5. Location. You're in the middle of nowheresville PA so I'm not really sure the location matters, but this Holiday Inn is within walking distance of a convenience store and a few restaurants, which is probably more than most hotels in this area can say.

Honestly, there's a Marriott right down the street, just give that a shot. Maybe it's all the same but it would be worth taking the risk. I would use this hotel as more of an overpriced bar than a place to stay, though I guess there aren't a ton of options in the area. It is what it is.

Long story short, if you ever have an issue with your stay it is IMPOSSIBLE to get a hold of the hotel manager, it's like one doesn't even exist.  Was later informed from the front desk lady over the phone that ""They did a thorough investigation and didn't find any bed bugs."" I take this to mean that they sent a member of their staff to poke around the room.  I highly doubt the called in a professional exterminator, which means those evil bugs are still there.

On top of this the room was DISGUSTING.  There were huge stains all over the bed sheets, looked like somebody had been murdered there and the staff just dumped a bucket of bleach on the sheets and called it a day.

I have NEVER encountered such a lack of customer service. I travel every year and have stayed in countless hotels. Yet I've never witness such a disconnect from pleasing the customer. Upon arriving to the hotel my husband was met with an unprofessional desk clerk and accommodations that we hadn't reserved. We just got married and requested a king size bed but was put into a double room with absolutely no resolve. Even after my sister talked to management nothing could be done, nor was any compensation offered. Moreover, we woke up to loud noises and banging due to construction that we were not notified about. When me husband called down to the front desk we were told ""sorry for not letting you know earlier but there's no compensation that can be given!"" As a frequent traveler, you encounter situations that are beyond managements control. However, a business that cares about their customers compensate you for what's in their control. This hotel has no qualms about telling their customers no and not following up with any sort of compensation to ease the customers let downs. The saddest part of this stay is this hotel is situated in a prime location which is very accessible to city life.  The best part of our stay-cation was when we weren't in the hotel. We were able to walk to Redding Terminal for lunch and just experience down town. It's extremely unfortunate that I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone. I have never felt so underserved and ignored in a hotel before. Despite its prime location, this hotel is a -1 for me. You would also like to think that if the service is bad the rooms are amazing. The rooms are a let down as well. The rooms are  not modernized and the beds are uncomfortable. We were also told that because we have a comped reservation that we couldn't be moved to another room. We were given our stay as a wedding gift. I found that comment to be very rude and revealed that staff had no intention of even treating us like a regular customer. I hope that management figures out a better plan for training their staff and creating an environment where customers feel heard, appreciated and ultimately satisfied with their experience.

I have a 2-bedroom suite on the top floor and could hear the baby crying all night as well the extra vocal caretaker entertaining the baby. The hotel staff asked me from which room it was coming from, I said to her that I worked all day; it's not my job to walk around the hotel trying to figure this out. This went on every night, and each night involved a call to the front desk to handle the noisy neighbor. 
The room is nice, but after working all day, I need a quiet atmosphere to rest. Ridiculous! 
Also - I was sitting on the curb in front of the hotel entrance (seemed harmless enough) talking on the phone with my friend about my dog that just passed. I was crying and upset, in a quiet way, and the hotel shuttle comes into the drive and the driver asked me to move. I was sitting in front of a ""no parking - by order of fire marshal"" so I said to the driver that the sign said ""no parking"", and then he got an attitude with me and yelled at me to move. I told him to calm down, that my dog died and I'm having a bad day because of it, and he said in a snotty tone, ""sorry your dog died but you need to move!!!"", and then he continued to talk about me to the people in his shuttle, highly unprofessional. 
Not a great way to treat or communicate with Hyatt Global members; I will stay somewhere else next time.

The hotel is formerly a Summerfield Suites that is starting to show some age. I actually toured both this Hyatt House and the Hyatt House in King of Prussia and the KOP location is nicer and newer, but also more expensive. There is nothing wrong with the hotel, but you can tell it is showing some age. 

Positives:
-The rooms are large with a full size fridge, dishwasher, microwave and small sink. Plenty of living room space with a small eat in desk/table and a pull out couch. Plenty of storage space with a dresser, night stands, full size closet and a very large bathroom vanity. Standard size tub/shower.

-HVAC system is a full size apartment style unit, not a through wall unit. This provides for quiet operation with quick heating and or cooling. The caveat is that the thermostat they are using is motion activated to conserve energy with can mean warm nights when the tstat does not detect movement in the living room and defaults to a higher than set set point.

-rooms are quiet. Over my 67 night stay I never experienced an issue with noise either from adjacent rooms or from the pool area.

-price. The hotel worked with me and my per diem rate that I was given by my employer to allow me to stay at a rate below their standard long term rate. They  also seem to be cheaper than other similar fully equipped suites in the area on a standard room rate.

-location. The hotel is close to highways, shopping malls and restaurants. Some within walking distance, others 2-3 mile drive. 

Cons- 
-off putting smell from the 4th floor. I can only describe it as mildew masked with mint air freshener. I am not sure if they have a moisture issue with the 4th floor or what but the entire 4th floor smells like this. And my room smelled even worse. I got used to it, but upon coming home after 2 months I had to was everything thoroughly and Fabreeze all my luggage.  With this being said I would request a room that is not on the 4th fl.

Mehs-
- I was never blown away by the staff. I have only stayed at a few Hyatt properties over the years, although I travel frequently for work staying mostly at Marriott. There were only a handful of front desk clerks who seemed welcoming. The breakfast crew was always nice and friendly and the cleaning staff/maintenance were also pleasant. The woman running the evening social hour seemed almost unhappy to be there though.  Overall I never got the warm and fuzzy from the hotel. The hey we appreciate your patronage. I'd say it was more indifference than anything else. Not a huge deal, but being a hotel and part of the hospitality sector I expected just a bit more from the staff.  I happened to stay at the Hyatt Place in Portland, Maine while in the area and they knocked it out of the park. They are also a brand new property and as such probably have a greater focus on such things. 

-gym is fairly well equipped. Better than many although I've been to nicer. The issue I had was that it never seemed like it was really maintained from a restocking standpoint (water glasses, picking up after guests) and this is the first hotel I've been in where there weren't Lysol type wipes to sanitize equipment. 

Overall this is a property I'd recommend. The rooms are spacious, clean and well appointed. If not newly updated. Price seems fair for the type of room with the only big caveat being the really odd smell on the 4th floor.  Staff won't knock your socks off but they aren't rude either. If you can get a room on another floor it's a hotel worth staying at.",2014-08-05 02:02:38

Yes there is a plexiglas sheet but it's 2 feel wide and the front desk person is most of the time not behind it. 
On top of that there are been parties almost every day with groups between 10 and 50 people, no mask!!!
I came here because my son who lives in Downingtown just had a baby and he recommended this place that hosts first responders who are working with COVID patients.
So we are talking about guests who are at risk in an hotel where almost no one wears a mask. 
There is a sign asking the guests to wear a mask but it seems ignored. I don't dare to touch anything in the hotel. 
I made a comment at the front desk and asked them to make an effort couple times but my request was totally ignored.

Why 2 stars and not zero? Because in the week since I've been here, I saw 2 times employees wearing a mask. Unfortunately they are not the regular ones. So it is my way of saying thank you to those two employees to at least try. 

We are in this pandemic together. I'm not paranoid, otherwise I would not stay in an hotel but I would appreciate if they follow the minimum safety requirements to make everyone safer. 

Updated: lowered to one star after I talking to the management who seems to not care. Tom said he will ""mention it to staff"" while wearing a paper mask barely covering his mouth. I reminded him that breathing includes mouth and nose!
It's infuriating to see that business that have a chance and people who are lucky to have a job don't do their part. 
Agree or not to the role of a mask, if you ask your customers to wear one, you have to do the same!!! And if you are the manager of this hotel, inspire your team by making an effort.

Update #2: I guess they listened. Today the staff was wearing mask most of the time. I hope it stays that way.

Although this property is not much to write home about on the exterior, it is very comfortable, inside.  Upon check-in for my near three-week biz trip to the Courtyard Marriott Reno Downtown/Riverfront, I was greeted by a pleasant woman (shift manager, I presume), Suzanne.  She noticed my preferred status, and the duration of my stay, and was kind to offer me a ""riverfront view"" room. The room, although small-ish (and it did have a nasty centipede on the wall above the coffee maker, upon arrival) was/is otherwise very comfortable.  After that, my positive experience ends. Upon arrival for my 16 night stay (I am still amidst the duration of my stay), I informed the front desk that my partner (now my fiance - which, to my surprise, happened on this trip!) would be arriving Wednesday to join me for a week.  I ensured that his name was added to the room, informed them of the day/time of arrival, and obtained an extra key. That part all went uneventfully. During the day of my check-in/travel, I began to feel under the weather and consequently was in the hotel room most of the following three days with illness.  I had the room cleaned the second/third day (I state this, as there was a housekeeping visit and hotel access to the room).  I am aware and supportive of policies and actions which make sense for hotel staff and guest security.  I also understand in the wake of recent happenings (i.e. Mandalay Bay, Vegas massacre), many hotels have made room-check and entry policies more visible, and more enforced, to protect the safety of all. I support that.  I consider myself very self-aware, cognizant, and not the least bit naive. I also am very aware that rooms that have DND up for consecutive days garner attention regarding this. (Note: I had been in and out of the hotel, had been seen by mgt. and staff, and had not had my DND up continuously.)  I am including this detail to communicate my support of awareness and legitimate safety precautions.  I have a background and much success in fraud prevention in the financial arena, so I ""get it"". This is where my acknowledgement of policy and my understanding of the need for safety departs from my personal horrible experience, and poor (in my opinion, discriminatory) treatment.  More specifically, my recount is to enlighten other visitors (especially LGBT or minority visitors) about the poor, even deceiving route that Marriott staff took in affronting me and my partner (now-fiance).  The evening my partner arrived to the hotel, despite notice of his arrival (and his being on the reservation) he was unnecessarily stopped, and was treated like an intruder.  He texted me that he was there, as I was expecting him, and I offered to come down to meet him. I wanted to ensure we didn't pass each other in different elevators.  Logical, from my perspective.  Before I could come down, they had stopped and held him as if he were unwelcome (note: a room key is not required for elevator functionality, nor should it matter - hotel guests have visitors all the time, masseurs, etc.). The front desk called up to my room and asked if he had my permission to come up.  I stated that he was on the room, hotel staff was notified, and this was not only okay, it was communicated in advance. Fast forward to his arrival to the room, a quick settling, and we proceeded to leave the hotel for dinner.  As we left the room (15 mins after his arrival and settling) to get some dinner after an 8 hr travel day for him, and at a relatively late dinner hour (9pm MST; his midnight ET), I shut the door to our room. He said ""oh, I forgot something in the room"".  When I tried to use the key to get back in, it did not work (it worked minutes earlier).  He said ""never-mind, we can get it later"".  We proceeded downstairs, I asked for the key card to be re-keyed.  An awkward, nervous-seeming young woman ""helped"" us, and we went to dinner.  As we returned from what I learned was a very special dinner, immediately after becoming engaged (to my elation and surprise!),  we were literally bum-rushed by the inexperienced late-shift employee and a female security guard, flagging us down and running after us (no exaggeration), stating they needed to speak with us about a situation.  We would later put the pieces together that not only did this feel entirely odd, it was presented very dishonestly.  Notwithstanding, it completely put a damper on a once-in-a-lifetime, special evening. To expedite the story, the staff made some story about our ""smoke alarm going off in our room"", and she and security needed to get up into the room and check things out.  It all happened very fast, seemed very odd, and we were made to feel very uncomfortable by the approach.  My fiance and I were open, inviting, holding nothing back, in order for the hotel safely to be assured. Upon arrival and entry to the room, oddly (part 1 of 2)...",2018-04-15 09:04:14

I had the unique privilege of being twice burned by this Holiday Inn.  I did a priceline bid for two separate stays (on a Thursday night and on a Saturday night -- bookending a trip to Kitt Peak).  For both stays, I got this Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites for about $50 including tax.  Priceline's bid now function has never led me wrong -- until this trip.

On our Thursday stay, I woke up to a GIANT COCKROACH in the bathroom.  My fiance killed it and then called the front desk to let them know.  When I went to check out, they acted like he must've been lying because he told housekeeping not to bother coming to kill it (it was already dead and in the trash can).  I showed them the photo on my iPhone, and she happily informed me that it was a sewer cockroach.  As if I cared.  No apology, no offer of anything.  I suggested that they comp our appetizers from the previous night (speaking of which, our waitress the previous night was seriously wacked out and unprofessional)... after consulting another person at the front desk, it was decided that that was possible.  Again, no initiative to make me a happy guest after dealing with a roach.

On our Saturday stay (which is ongoing at the time of this writing), they made us wait an hour for our room (until 4pm) after first trying to put us in a smoking room.  Why wasn't our room ready at 3pm as promised?  Well, they had been booked the night before and didn't have enough housekeeping staff to clean the rooms in time for a 3pm turnover.  So, we WASTED ONE HOUR of our lives waiting for the room to be cleaned.  To make matters worse, they initially told us it would be 30 minutes for our room to be ready.  I had to go to the desk 3 times before getting a room -- each time waiting in a line of similarly frustrated travelers.  Another guest asked if breakfast could be comped given the inconvenience, and the woman helping her would only give her and her husband one comped breakfast because she ""can't give all 56 people waiting a comp breakfast.""  Well, if you promised 56 peoples rooms at 3pm and then failed to hire adequate staff to make that happen, then yes you can and yes you should!

I will never stay here again.  And to make sure this never happens, I will never use the bidding function on priceline to book a room in the Tucson airport area.  (Speaking of which, this hotel is much further from the airport than the other airport hotels.  On the plus side, the shuttle drivers were quite nice and were by far the most professional people we encountered here.)",2010-10-09 23:33:42

After the 2nd night, my co-worker in a different room informed me she had bed bugs. A different front desk person Felysha said ""oh yea we fumigated for bed bugs last week"". Felysha was also super rude and unprofessional. We travel for work a few times a month and this was the worst hotel service ever. You'd think they would be kinder considering there was a bug problem. 

My favorite part was retrieving the coffee mug I left in my first room - I was told housekeeping would wash it and hold it at the front desk for me - they never bothered to remove the dead centipede from inside it. Never have I wanted to run away screaming from a hotel before.

When I went past the front desk for breakfast the next morning, the clerk didn't even make eye contact. 
They advertise queen beds but, unfortunately, both rooms had doubles instead. A fridge and microwave are in the room and the bathroom facility was adequate. 
They were power washing the sidewalks when were there as well. No need for a wake-up call at 8a since they fired up the very loud machines right about then (and the noise went on for hours). Nice that they are trying to improve the place, but they blew a bunch of paint chips under the door onto the carpet and never bothered to vacuum them up either night we were there.
The outdoor pool appeared nice but had a lot of debris - no one had skimmed it out. The hot tub was not working properly -  no working air jets and only ""bathtub"" warm.
It seems like this could be a decent place but is just poorly managed.

Our room also did not have a shower curtain, on our way out for the day we advised the front desk.  When we returned back later that day we found our door propped open with the latch.  Who knows how long it was like that. 

My card for incidentals was charged for the full price of the room.  Even tho the room was prepaid with a corporate credit card.

We checked in yesterday and were given 2 key cards for our room. Aside from our room not having a # on the door, the keys didn't work. My husband went back down to the front desk and was given another set of keys and was told he deactivated them when he put them by his cell phone (which he never did). Those second set of keys didn't work either. He went down again and requested for someone to come up with him. When the worker came up he opened the door with no problem with his master key and said ""you just need to put it in like this"". Now we travel a lot and stay in hotels often enough to know how to use these keys. So we said ""use the keys that were given to us"" and sure enough they did not work. He then says the front desk didn't program them. DUH!!! 

So 30 minutes later we were able to walk into a room that smelled like wet, dirty carpet. We reserved and prepaid for a king executive room but there was no sofa bed in the room. My husband used the bathroom and the toilet didn't flush. The alarm clock on the nightstand wasn't programmed and it was blinking 5:07 which means I'm 5 hours no one checked on the room and reset it. When the worker came back with an update about our new keys he told us they couldn't program keys for that room. My husband told them about the non-working toilet and we were offered another room.

20 minutes after that, so now almost 50 minutes since we checked in, we were given another room down the hall. The smell was better. Still no sofa bed as we were told as per the website would be in our room. The toilet flushed but the pressure was so low. And thank god I found this, but there was a piece of broken glass on the floor! If my 15 month old son had stepped in it I would be suing them now!!! Their housekeeping is disgraceful and the room was not worth he money we paid for. 

Our reservation came with breakfast included. No one at the front desk gave us any information about where, what time, etc. When we found the breakfast area and told he waitress it was included in our reservation she asked for our vouchers-which we were never given. So again, my husband went to the desk.

We asked for apple juice for our 15 month old son and we're given orange juice. My husband and I both ordered coffee and we had no spoons. The breakfast was decent though, I'll give them that much. But the employees seemed to not realize how loud they were went the went into their back room that we heard all their conversations about their tables, their schedule, etc. so unprofessional. 

At one point my husband ran into another person staying in the hotel who warned him to be careful bc he had bedbugs in his room and was carrying sample in a zip lock bag. Needless to say we checked the bed in our room before putting anything down.

They called my room 2 times within 5 minutes of checking in and was lectured after I went to bus Services to try and get on computer to get ahold of friend as I left personal cell phone home. The Supervisor was rude as I have ever encountered. My friend called hotel as the fax was malfunctioning and she finally got through after hours of trying and all was good. Well until I went to the restaurant. There again a rude Hostess who did not acknowledge my presence for at least 5 minutes then was told to wait she had a phone call lol! Finally seated Waitress excellent. Next morning went to breakfast and was told after another 5 minutes of leaning on the hostess desk they were not open until 6 am. It was 610 am. Rude as I have EVER encountered in ANY Marriott my hotel of choice always if I can get rates company allows.

Upon checking out again utter rudeness not to me but comments about person who called and the phone rang at least 40 times before she answered. I was trying to checkout and they did not have all charges posted properly including breakfast (but the gift shop transaction from 2 minutes prior was there and they are not Marriott). Was told would get email. None came. Expenses due. Now I call hotel and rudely am told will take 3 days at least. Unacceptable.

I will mention I tried to call for wakeup call, no answer on 3 tries.

I think you need to do a secret shopper test of the restaurant hostess as well as the front desk. The service is non existent except for the excellent wait staff.OT a chance. May stay again if rate under 100 per night but no way otherwise. Platinum members butter the bread and sometimes they use special rates but stay loyal to a usually superior brand.

The staff needs to go to Renaissance at the Newark, NJ Airport and see how this is run. The staff there from shuttle driver, front desk, hostess, wait staff and Managers are EXCELLENT!

Truly an absolute disappointment and still appalled it takes 3 days or more in 2014 to email a bill. PS I get it within an hour from the Newark Marriott!

  On the night of July 29, 2008 me and my boyfriend, Tim, went to the font desk of the Hilton Garden Inn Reno to pay for our room. The front desk agent, Cory, told me that I had about $30.00 worth of phone charges to my room. I then told him that I was told the night before that the calls were free or I wouldn't have used the phone. He then told me that since it was there mistake telling me that, that they would have them taken off, but he had to get it approved by management first. He then told us that he would have the receipt brought up to my room. Later that night when we returned to our room around 12 midnight there was no receipt in the room so we went down to the front desk.
   When we got to the front desk the agent was helping 4 other guest checking in. When she was done I went up to the desk and told her what room I was in and the we were supposed to have a receipt brought up, but didn't receive it. She then turned around and grabbed a receipt from the back desk and asked if I was Miss. M*** when I told her yes she slammed the receipt down on the desk and said in a rude voice that her manager was not going to have the charges taken off my room. I then told her that it was not right because the 2 agents from the morning said that they would have them taken off because I shouldn't have been charged.
   She then looked at me and very rudely asked me ""Don't you work for a Double Tree hotel, a Hilton property?"" I then told her Yes I do. She then got in my face and pointed at me and said ""You should have known better."" I then grabbed the receipt and started to walk away. As I walked away I said ""This is the last time I ever stay in this hotel."" As we walked down the hall to the elevators I was telling Tim that I was going to go to my management and tell them how rude they had been to us the entire stay when all of a sudden I heard the front desk agent screaming down the hall at us and practically jumping over the desk at us. Saying that she was going to kick us out of the hotel. I then screamed back at her, "" I would like to see you try, we didn't do anything."" about 5 seconds after, I turned to see her charging down the hall still screaming at me, with a security officer behind her. She was still yelling that she was going to have us kicked out and that she knew what room we were in. Me and Tim then got on to the elevator and went up to our room. 
   When I got to the room I called to have the security officer come up to our room. When he came to the room I answered the door and I apologized and told him what had happened. I then told him I wanted to speak with a manager right away. He then left and came back about 5-10 minutes later and said that the manager would like to speak with me in the morning I then asked if he could possibly call me in my room so I could explain what had happened. He then left. About 10 minutes later I got a call in my room from the front desk agent. She again very rudely told me that her manager didn't want to speak with me right now and that he was not going to refund me any of my money for the night and that we were more then welcome to leave. I then told her that I would rather just leave because she was still being rude and hung up. She called back to my room and Tim answered, she told him that security would be back up to escort us out of the hotel and hug up on him. We were then escorted out of the hotel at 12:30am and drove home.

I don't complain much, but this honestly exceded my tolerance for a shity hotel. Let me begin with my check-in to the hotel. Afrer a long day of driving I stopped in Tucson to take a break. I assumed that the best option for accommodations would be a Quality Inn, mainly because I stayed in one the night before in California. As I made my way into the lobby I felt like I was in some type of horror movie. I though that I had entered into that ""no vacancy"" movie because of all the run down crusty ass buildings and badly maintained parking lot. However I was tired so I overlooked this and went into my room. Immediately upon entereing I though that I had entered into a fucking 1970's twilight zone haunted hotel or something, but again (foolish me) I attempted to give the room a chance. I didn't do much inpection at night mainly because I was tired (and because the room lacked so much lighting), and I was also afraid that I would find some hidden camera or secret dorway in which a serial killer would come out and kill me in my sleep. So I (attempted) to sleep, but it was hard because the mattress was freaking hard like a rock. I got up after hours of tossing and turning and that was when the nightmare trully began. Upon closer inpection I found a cockroach crawling on the floor (probably because the door had a huge opening which you'll see in the photos), but trust me. That was just the fucking appetizer. As I made my way around the sunlit room (it was daytime at this point) i saw stains on the walls, on the carpets, on the tile in the bathroom, and even worst, on my bed. As i made my way into the bathroom I couldnt help to notice the filthy mess that had plagued it. Ive seen public restroom in way better condition than this one, in fact even my school bathroom (which is crapy) was in better conditon then this 1970's murder scene. I honestly overlooked the antique television, phone, and furniture that loitered this hotel but there were to many other problems that made this the worst, most confusing, hotel experience of my life. I have so much more to say but ill just end my saying that you are WAY better off staying at that motel 6 thing around the corner.

I'm in my room now, and I guess they completely forgot to restock it. There is no hand soap, no shampoo, no conditioner-- and no towels. I just ran to the front desk and the girl working was very sweet and totally shocked that the room was missing _everything_. She asked me if the coffee bar was stocked and I was like, there's a coffee bar? She looked at me and was like, ""There's not even a coffee pot?"" No, there is no coffee pot. 

There is an empty space where a refrigerator used to live. There are two used, dirty wash cloths on the shelf in the closet. 

But don't worry guys, there is a Bible in the drawer. I know I was pretty worried about that detail. We can all relax.

I heard that Tucson is really busy right now with a Gem Show, so perhaps that's the reason my room was overlooked.

Let's start with the good stuff cause there's lots of it. A clean, comfortable hotel IN the airport. Flying into Philadelphia late at night? You walk off the airplane, out of security and you are AT the hotel. That's cool. The front desk people are awesome, we have an amazing view of the runways (but no noise - how did they do that?), and even the bar is super fun. There's a little store and a Starbucks and if you're buying coffee in the morning, you'll meet Shawn, who is just awesome and friendly and cool. If you see her, tell her Mary said hi. 

But ....

Here's the hard part. Because everyone - especially Shawn - is so lovely here, I had no hesitation at all in letting my 13 year old kid run down to the store for a candy bar on Saturday night.  Now this kid can handle himself, he travels alone all the time and we let him loose in Boston on the regular. So I was stupified when he came back all flustered and upset.  I had given him a few dollars and he decided to bring back candy for everyone so he was a dollar short .... tried to charge to the room but wasn't sure he had the right number ... and the cashier snarled at him and told him she didn't have time to wait for him.  What?!?!  This is not a kid who would be rude or inconsiderate, not that I'd excuse poor service even if he was. But he's got good manners.

Obviously something is up with that cashier.  I went back next morning and made sure that the charge got to the correct room, and I'll speak to management, but it is clear that the truly excellent training at this hotel has not trickled down to one employee. Or maybe she was having a bad night. Whatever, it's no big deal, but it cost the Marriott a star in my book.  And kind of wrecked the kid's night.

Due to a check engine light and a family concern we felt we would not be able to keep driving. So we call the hotel and speak to Ruth, I inform her we need to cancel our booking. All she stated was the card was automatically charged at 6pm and she did not have the authorization to refund our money. I asked specifically several questions about getting our money back. She did not say there was no way to get a refund, she just simply stated the manager doesn't work weekends and we would have to call Monday to get a refund. She was vague and gave zero info, she simply kept stating she wasn't the manager and does not deal with refunds. 

So I call Monday morning. I am told the manager is in a meeting. I call an hour later and was told the manager was helping a guest. It was at this time I left my name and number and was told the manager would call me back when she was done. I then call around 2pm and am given a talking to about how busy the manager is, she has to shop for the hotel, she is in meetings, blah blah blah. I then call Monday around 6pm and the manager left for the day before returning my call. This time I spoke to Patricia who was rude and condescending to me over the phone, telling me how busy her manager was and how only the manager can authorize refunds. When asked to be given the number to a higher up manager I was told I needed to google that number myself that she would not do it for me. When asked about the owner of the hotel, I was told he was also not available but I can leave a message. 

Tuesday, I wait until 5:30pm to call since I still have not received a call. I was again told by the person who answered that the manager had left for the day and they could not authorize a refund. 

Wednesday. Still no word from Judith Felix the manager, still no word from the owner Al Patel. I call around 2pm and finally spoke to the manager. 

The end result? The manager telling me there was no way she would refund my $170. I informed her of her staffs vague and uninformed help, I explained to her that the third party site had nowhere stated their policy. On the very la Quinta website the policy is vague and leaves it up to the managers discretion. 

The manager was rude to me, tried to accuse me of lying to her, and spoke over me with aggression. 

Due to this hotel stealing my money I will be filing a civil suit against them and taking them to court. The absolute most unprofessional hotel I have ever dealt with.

During my stay the fire alarm went off, we were all kicked outside in the 16 degree weather until firefighters arrived, only for them to ""forget"" to tell us we can go back to our rooms- and it turned out to be a false alarm! 
THEN-- everyday for breakfast it was horrible! There were no eggs, no gravy, cereal was stale, and I had to remind them to turn on the juice dispenser. 

The hotel staff would rather sit around and talk/text/ask you for cigarettes instead of doing their jobs! 

Apparently the manager didn't like how I parked/where I parked either and had to walk his fat self over and come say something about it! Meanwhile while the fire alarms go off he has no problem yelling at people to ""don't go to your damn rooms!""

While the hotel staff are friendly and respectful, the quality of the hotel in respect to the price that guest pay was inequivalent. As a frequent traveler, I was quiet disappointed with my stay.  During my weekend stay, I experienced a shower without hot water as well as a broken air conditioning unit.  In the first room that I was assigned to, the shower water was ice cold, and did not heat as expected. When I called down to the front desk to have the shower looked at and fixed, I was told that they would come up to the room to fix it before 9pm. After stepping out for dinner and returning to the hotel room at 10:30pm, I tested the shower, and again, the water was ice cold. I then called down to the front desk again to see if they ever sent someone to the room, and admittedly so, they had not.  i then was moved to another room down the hall with a working shower, however as a trade-off the air conditioning unit was broken. Again the next day i called down to ask if the AC unit could be fixed, however my request were ignored. 

I hope this feedback will be utilized to improve the quality of rooms and service provided for others who may choose to stay at this establish. However, sadly due to my experience staying at this hotel this weekend, this is not a hotel I would recommend to others to stay while visiting the city of brotherly love.",2018-06-03 03:35:43

Leann Hurley with an attitude gave the bottle of water and refused the extended check out with out looking at the room number my family member was staying in. Her reasoning was too many people ""in our party"" requested a extended check out. The hotel is not obligated to grant an extended check out but that decision was made because too many of ""our party"" requested an extended check out. Only one person of the 10 whom stayed here requested the extended checkout. Mind you Leann did not check the room number it was a denied because too many of ""us"" requested a check out. The other folks whom requested the check out were African American. Clearly in Leanns mind we were altogether and we were denied this service without checking whom we were or our rooms.

7WUMUi0TH4A4jisRdIiZMQ,j9j9BF6gqCIzjijLroJyAA,-taSmAqWt1ZtWJSjLYZW9A,1,3,0,1,"This is a two part review. The first is about the initial stay. When I booked my room, no where on the website or on the emailed reservation did it say that a $100 hold was going to be needed to complete the reservation. I did book through booking.com but I did my reservation and the Quality Inn website and this information was not on the website. When I got to the hotel on 06/09/2018, I asked the young lady at the desk if I was able to check in early. She asked for my ID and my credit card. She said yes we do and then said that there would be an additional $100 hold. I told her that I didn't have an additional $100 available to me on any card and she told me to hold on for a moment. She spoke to a ""manager"" who told her to refund me my money and to cancel the reservation. I only found out that the reservation was going to be cancelled because I asked her what the next steps were and she said that the room would be cancelled.  When I went to check my bank account, I saw that the money for the room was immediately taken from my account but not immediately put back. I talked to my bank and my customer service rep told me that someone from the hotel had to finalize the transaction in order for me to get my money back immediately. A supervisor with the customer service center said that she was sending an email to the general manager who was supposed to call me back on 6/10/2018. I did not receive a phone call back on 06/10/2018. I called the customer service representative again on 06/11/2018 and was given the GM's direct email.  For this first part of the complaint-my issue was that the customer service rep did not fully disclose the amount of money that was needed for my stay before she swiped my card.  She was rude when I called back to speak to a manager. I have never stayed at a hotel that did not fully explain the check in process and the money that was needed. I did file a complaint through the Quality Inn & Suites customer services (#9101559) but I'm not confident that they will be helpful because over all the phone calls I made, I was told that they do not have control over how the franchise runs the business. 

The 2nd part has to do with the GM.  Mind you, I called the hotel on 06/09/2018 and 06/11/2018. At those times no manager was available. When you call the Quality Inn & Suites in West Chester Pa, the voicemail indicates that a woman is the manager but you can't leave a message because the voice mail is full.  I emailed the general manager on 06/11/2018. He decided to call me back on 06/18/2018. Another point I should mention is that when I spoke to the customer service rep on 06/11/2018, I was told that the GM sent an email saying that he tried to call me and email on 06/10/2018. At that time, I told the customer service rep that that was not true-no one tried to contact me. Now today, the general manager calls me and apologizes, saying that this was the 1st time he had to contact me because he was out on vacation. So, that is an inconsistency. I told the GM about my experience with his hotel. I also told him that it was ridiculous that this happened on 06/09/2018 and he was just now getting back to me. He said that sometimes he just needed to walk away from his hotel and thats what he did because he needed a break. My concern with that is, he left his hotel to be managed by people who had no clue what they were doing, or at least in my case that first front desk clerk had no idea what she was doing.  He proceeded  to tell me that 1) all hotels have holds when guests stay 2) I should have had more money on me since I was traveling and 3) that it was not his responsibility to update his website because the parent company of Choice Hotels is responsible for that.  I told him that it is his responsibility to train his employees to be upfront with what the total costs will be when staying at this hotel. I also told him that he doesn't have the right to tell me how much money I should travel with.....he had no clue what was in my pocket or what was available to me through another source. For him to insinuate what he was trying to insinuate was appalling.  He then told me that he didn't want to hear anything else I had to say, he told me to enjoy the weather in West Virginia (which is not even someplace that I live) then he hung up.  Now my issues with him are 1) the time in which it took him to respond to not only my initial complaint, but to my email as well 2) the way in which he spoke to me as if I should just be clairvoyant and know automatically every charge that would occur with this hotel stay instead of expecting his front desk clerk to be upfront 3) and the fact that he hung up on me. I do not expect him to speak to or correct the front desk clerk who helped me because he exhibited the same behavior she did. I'm also upset that Choice hotels keeps pawning off responsibility on the local hotel and the local hotel keeps pawning off responsibility on the parent company.",2018-06-18 16:03:54

They refused to comp us for this.  It was the least that they could do.  Pathetic.  Other people were also waiting a long time for their rooms.

2) We found a large black roach in the restroom.  I killed it.  They didn't believe me.  Ridiculous.

The carpet in the room was stained all over. There was hair on the comforter and chunks of soap and brown particles (god only knows what that was) were floating in the jacuzzi. 

The hotel itself was noisy and not because of it being so close to the roads. I could hear all kinds of whirring and humming while laying down in bed. This could have been from their AC/heating unit but it was very bothersome.

The worst part was when the fire alarm in the room was chirping and woke me up at 12:30 AM. I called the front desk and asked for someone to fix it and the person told me there was no one available to do it. She then proceeded to tell me how I can fix it myself. Not very professional to ask a guest to fix something in a room they're paying for. 

The staff was rude to my husband upon checkout and didn't want to let us back into our room when my husband needed to grab the rest of our bags. The front desk person was yelling over her walkie-talkie for someone to let my husband in and it seemed like such a hassle for her to help us with this.

During my most recent phone conversation, I was again told the manager was not available. I explained my concern as the website was now saying the hotel was fully booked for the date I needed (it wasn't during the first 4 calls). I asked if it was possible to reserve the room while we waited for the manager to be freed up from what they were working on. At this point, I got accused of yelling at the receptionist and told that she had the right to refuse service. She stated that my repeated attempts to speak to a manager were not acceptable. She said she had the right to refuse service and if I wanted to speak to the owner (I didn't) they would support her. I calmly asked if she could just reserve the one room remaining and I could handle the other situation at a later date. She took my last name and proceeded to hang up on me!

I have worked in the service industry my entire life and know how horrible it can be to work with pushy customers, I never once was rude or raised my voice.  I was offended and am embarrassed for the team at this establishment.

It should be noted that after 4 phone calls over two weeks, I was never able to book a room. Perhaps they could train the reception desk staff to take down contact information and have the manager contact potential guests who are in need of their services or give the staff the authority to handle such tasks.

The only reason I came here again is because it was the closest hotel to philly that accepted pets and had breakfast included.  Not even sure why I cared about breakfast in hindsight because it's gross.  I ate out both mornings.  The room which is supposed to be non smoking smells like stale cigarettes and the carpet is filthy.  The staff is unfriendly and unprofessional.  Loitering around the lobby gossiping, talking loudly, and smoking directly in front of the entrance.  They also casually hang out in the breakfast area and watch TV like they aren't at work. My main issue is the weird unauthorized holds on my bank account.  I paid in full the night I checked in (including 27 dollars per night for my dog) totaling 254.00. Saturday night I glanced at my account app and there were not one, but TWO strange amounts on my account as holds. One for 54.00 and one for 63 dollars....
Obviously I went to the desk to inquire why those charges were there.  Debbie the supervisor was not helpful at all. She had a poor nasty attitude and kept telling me that ""it was the computers fault, the computer messed up"".
After repeatedly telling her that it didn't matter why or who messed up, that I just wanted my money released, she said she needed to fax my bank some form.  When I called my bank they said that she needed to provide approval codes for those TWO transactions which she could not do.  And apparently the only one who can is the general manager who was not in on the weekends.  So now I get to wait until Monday with these charges on my account that weren't authorized and were a mistake.  My bank could've released the hold immediately with those codes.  She didn't attempt to contact the general manager, didn't apologize until I pointed out that she never did and was just all around horrible at her job. 
I'm disgusted and turned off and I don't think she needs to be the supervisor of anything if customer service isn't a priority for her.  Do not stay here.  Go somewhere else, its definitely not worth it and is obviously cheap for a reason.",2016-10-15 13:39:58

I complained to the front desk on 3 separate occasions and was met with dismissive, rude and unprofessional behavior. The last, most recent incident occurred this morning when 3 construction workers followed closely behind me into the building from outside. The 3 men weren't wearing masks and were talking amongst themselves. When I reminded them that masks are mandated by the state, one of them told me that a mandate (by the governor) wasn't a law. This was in full view and hearing of the front desk attendant. I asked her directly if they were enforcing the mask mandate. She looked away from me and said that it was being enforced. She refused to say anything to the 3 men as she watched them enter an elevator.

I had 6 staff members who would not provide their names when I asked for them and when I would ask questions they would ignore me like I wasn't asking them questions. Very unprofessional & blatantly disrespect to a paying customer. & I forgot to mention the house keeper literally charged at my boyfriend in a threatening manner. Police were called by me and I made a police report. They tried to charge me $400 smoking fee but once the police arrived and that's when upper management got involved. He never once tried to address me or my boyfriend before this but he was right there. Great management & excellent customer service!!!  They searched my room and trash for any evidence of smoking and there was none. The hotel manager went and checked the room after  said ""there was no damages to room but there was ashes in the ash tray"" BUT HOW THIS PROPERTY IS A NO SMOKING PROPERTY, so why  would they provide ash trays ?!  I'll wait It was BS !!!!!! to try to make them look better in front of the police, but it didn't work. The $400 was refunded and I will never stay there again.

We were directed to this horrible hotel through PRICELINE, and were booked for a 4-day stay, due to a family Memorial Service.  We traveled 2 days by car, to this hotel.  My wife and I are quiet senior citizens.  The first night we were there, our room phone rang at 1:00 A.M., waking us up, and informing us, ""You are making too much noise.""  We thought it just a joke and said we were asleep, and made no noise.  The second night, again, our room phone rang at 12:45 A.M., again informing us, ""You are making too much noise.""
If we could have left this terrible hotel, we would have, however we were informed by PRICELINE, that we would still be billed if we left.  The third day, we took our two small dogs to a park across the street from the hotel.  We no sooner got into our room, when the room phone rang again, ""You are making too much noise.  Stop it!""  I went downstairs to the desk, where I was greeted by a rather unprofessional, argumentative clerk by the name of ""Josh.""  I asked him what kind of noise we were making, and was the noise (from our room) investigated by anyone at the hotel?  I was appalled at the behavior of this young man.  Sure enough, the fourth night, the room phone rang again, ""You are making too much noise.  Cut it out.""  The next day, I met with the hotel General Manager, a Seola Wesley-Bailey, and the head of the Maintenance Staff, to ask and explain what had taken place.  I requested a refund, and the head of the Maintenance Staff said, ""I think I know where the problem was, and it was not with your room.""  The Manager said she would refund our room costs, after she ""reviewed tapes of the hotel.""  I have stayed in hotels all over the country, and never ever encountered a stay like this, with such lying, rude, and unresponsive people at this hotel!  It has been over a month now, and after many calls to the Extended Stay Guest Line, to complain about this hotel, I was supposed to receive a call from the District Manager, who called once, and never called back!
Do yourself a favor, and avoid this hotel at all costs!  The General Manager lies to people, no satisfaction from the Staff or from the Guest Line, and still NO refund for all they put us through.  The Staff was terrible, unresponsive to the harassment we were given by the constant calls -- One each day/night, saying we were making ""too much noise,"" but no one from the hotel cared enough to investigate and check out the situation!  They would have quickly learned we were NOT the cause of the noise!!
Our stay in this hotel was a complete NIGHTMARE!  They added to the stress of having to travel 2 days to attend a Memorial Service by calling our room each of the 4 days we stayed there, to confront us with lies about making ""too much noise.""
If you want a horrible, nightmare experience, then by all means, stay a night or two at this ""shakedown"" place.  Perhaps you too, will live to regret the stay.  If we could have left after the first two nights, we surely would have, but could not afford the extra expense to move to another hotel, as we already spent a lot of money for the trip!
In short -- Stay far away from this Extended Stay America Hotel, located on Dresher Road, in Horsham, PA!!

My experience at the Radisson was tepid at best, and a customer service nightmare at worst. I worked closely with the Radisson's Sales Manager, Rochelle Fronsdale, for over a year to ensure that my wedding block and after-party were planned and established well in advance of my wedding in December of 2021. While Rochelle was generally very responsive, efficient, and prompt, and altogether a joy to work with, I cannot say the same for the rest of the services that we received at the Radisson Hotel Philadelphia Northeast.

The rooms at the Radisson pale in comparison to hotels like the Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn in terms of modernity, cleanliness, and general feeling of kempt-ness. The rooms were dark, there were several outlets that did not have covers on them (we weren't sure if we could safely use them), and when we arrived in our rooms, many of the lamps were unplugged and off. Additionally, several of my wedding guests who booked rooms complained of the cleanliness of their bathrooms, as well as the lack of additional toilet paper and towels.

Additionally, we opted to purchase food from the hotel for our guests after the wedding. Firstly, we were not given the option to rent a space; Rochelle explicitly told us that there were none available at the time, but that we could expect to have the bar mostly to ourselves, as it was unlikely other events would be booked at the same time. We were also told that we were not allowed to bring in food from another vendor or book a food truck. The menu (see the pictures) was disappointingly small and very overpriced, but because the Radisson was our hotel and we had no other choice, we went with about $500 worth of food.

The night of the wedding, we arrived at the hotel only to find out food shoved into a nook at the back of the bar, which was overcrowded with at least two or three other parties of people. My mother-in-law had to ask several employees where our food even was before we could find it, and when we finally did, we saw that other patrons in the bar were eating the food that was laid out without anything to separate it from them. When we moved our food to the lobby to get away from the other patrons (some of whom actually tried to fight some of my party when it was pointed out that the food was not a free-for-all), the night manager Tara Hamilton had a security guard threaten to call the police on us. Tara Hamilton proceeded to yell, in an exceedingly unprofessional manner, at my uncle and my brother-in-law and threatened us several times to kick us out of the hotel completely. Finally, she directed us to a small area by the pool, at which point most of my party was so disgusted with the service and Tara's attitude that they just called it a night. On top of all of that, the food was ultimately substandard and not at all worth the amount of money we paid for it.

All in all, I would not stay at the Radisson - this location or any other - in the future, nor would I recommend it to anyone to use for wedding guests.

TLDR: Food is subpar, customer service is terrible, rooms are unclean. Find a different hotel.",2021-12-31 15:49:37

My husband and I stayed at this hotel during the Christmas holiday and I must strongly say what a disappointment choice of hotel it was. 

The staff has no consideration for their guest in regards to the comfort level and noise. We had some issues with our room, noise and the lack of professionalism of the hotel staff. As the issues were address to the front desk supervisor by the name of Judith, she raised her voice, was rude in her responses and showed no professionalism whatsoever in her role and her job duties as front desk hotel clerk. That is very unacceptable and employees with such lack of professional manner should be educated on great hospitality. When we expressed our issues with Judith, she moved our room from the 2nd floor to the 3rd floor. We grabbed our belongings and we basically moved everything one floor up and within 10mins of us sitting down, Judith calls us and said we need to move to the first floor because she could not authorize a new room without the approval of the manager. Due to her unprofessionalism and lack of hospitality experience, we had to again drag out belongings back to down to the 1st floor. We were ""TOLD"" by Judith that the hotel manager will be in at 9am to speak to us about our issues and concerns, and not once did the hotel manager come to our room to speak to us.  It seems like the front desk is clueless and they do not have a friendly, nor welcoming appearance.

In my many many travels all over the US, I have never paid a deposit other than for a pet, which I did not have on this trip, but due to an emergency, I felt I had no other choice but to pay it, so I paid it.

I look outside the peep hole to see what's going on- it's the housekeepers. No sense of respect for the people trying to get some rest in this hotel. It is currently 1:30 in the afternoon and I've been listening to their loud music since 8 this morning. Very unprofessional staff at this location I will not be returning.",2021-01-18 21:32:33
